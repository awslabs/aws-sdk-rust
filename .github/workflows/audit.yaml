        # chrono, a Rust date-time crate we use for timestamp parsing was added
        # to the RustSec vulnerability database because of a call to localtime_r.
        # We use chrono for an extremely narrow use case of converting epoch timestamps to UTC dates
        # (so we never invoke the problematic behavior that results from attempting to determine
        # the local time of the current platform).
        #
        # Chrono's only use is as an optional feature in `aws-smithy-types-convert`, for
        # the narrow use-case of converting from the SDK's `DateTime` into chrono types,
        # and we never invoke the problematic behavior that results from attempting to
        # determine the local time of the current platform.
