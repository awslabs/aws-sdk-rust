        One way to structure the description:
        `short summary of the bug`

        I tried this code:
        `code sample that causes the bug`

        I expected to see this happen: `explanation`

        Instead, this happened: `explanation`

        It's also helpful to enable trace logging and include the
        log messages as these will show the actual HTTP requests and
        responses. You can enable this by initializing `tracing-subscriber`
        if you haven't already (e.g., `tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();`),
        and then setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG` before
        running your program, as follows:
        `RUST_LOG='smithy_http_tower::dispatch=trace,smithy_http::middleware=trace'`

        For example:
        `RUST_LOG='smithy_http_tower::dispatch=trace,smithy_http::middleware=trace' cargo run`

        The SDK redacts sensitive information such as auth headers in these trace logs,
        but please look through them before posting just to be sure.
