One way to structure the description:

I tried this code:

I expected to see this happen: <explanation>

Instead, this happened: <explanation>

It's also helpful to enable trace logging and include the
log messages as these will show the actual HTTP requests and
responses. You can enable this by initializing `tracing-subscriber`
if you haven't already (e.g., `tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();`),
and then setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG` before
running your program, as follows:

`RUST_LOG='smithy_http_tower::dispatch=trace,smithy_http::middleware=trace'`

For example:

`RUST_LOG='smithy_http_tower::dispatch=trace,smithy_http::middleware=trace' cargo run`

The SDK redacts sensitive information such as auth headers in these trace logs,
but please look through them before posting just to be sure.
