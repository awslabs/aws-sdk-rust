        Provide a self-contained, concise snippet of code that can be used to reproduce the issue.
        For more complex issues provide a repo with the smallest sample that reproduces the bug.
        
        Avoid including business logic or unrelated code, it makes diagnosis more difficult.
        The code sample should be an SSCCE. See http://sscce.org/ for details. In short, please provide a code sample that we can copy/paste, run and reproduce.

        It's also helpful to enable debug logging and include the
        log messages as these will show the actual HTTP requests and
        responses. You can enable this by adding the `tracing-subscriber` crate with the `env-filter` feature,
        initializing it (e.g., `tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();`),
        and then setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG` before
        running your program, as follows:
        `RUST_LOG=debug`
        For example:
        `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`
        The SDK redacts sensitive information such as auth headers in these debug logs,
        but please look through them before posting just to be sure.
