# The AWS SDK for Rust [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-v0.0.12--alpha-blue)](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-sdk-rust/) ![MSRV](https://img.shields.io/badge/msrv-1.52.1-red)

This repo contains the new AWS SDK for Rust and its [public roadmap](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/projects/1)

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This SDK for Rust is code generated from [Smithy models](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/) that represent each AWS service. Code used to generate the SDK can be found in [smithy-rs](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs).

## Getting Started with the SDK

The new AWS SDK for Rust is built with one crate per AWS service. [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) must also be added as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. During the alpha, the SDK will not be pushed to crates.io and must be used via a Git dependency.

1. Create a new Rust project: `cargo new sdk-example`
2. Within your Cargo.toml file, add dependencies for DynamoDB and Tokio:

```toml
[dependencies]
dynamodb = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.12-alpha", package = "aws-sdk-dynamodb" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```
3. Provide your AWS credentials as environment variables:
  > **Note:** The alpha SDK only supports environment variable credential providers at this time. 

**Linux/MacOS**
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=... # eg. us-east-1
```
**Windows**
```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
set AWS_REGION=... # eg. us-east-1
```

4. Make a request using DynamoDB

```rust

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), dynamodb::Error> {
    let client = dynamodb::Client::from_env();
    let req = client.list_tables().limit(10);
    let resp = req.send().await?;
    println!("Current DynamoDB tables: {:?}", resp.table_names);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Prerequisites

In order to use the SDK for Rust, you must already have Rust and Cargo installed. If you don't, these instructions will show you how to install Rust and Cargo: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html

## Feedback and Contributing

### Feedback 

The alpha SDK uses **GitHub Issues** to track feature requests and issues with the SDK. In addition, we use **GitHub Projects** to provide users with a high level view of our roadmap and the features we're actively working on. 

You can provide feedback or report a bug  by submitting a **GitHub issue**. This is the preferred mechanism to give feedback so that other users can engage in the conversation, +1 issues, etc. Issues you open will be evaluated for our roadmap in the Developer Preview launch.

### Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the new AWS SDK for Rust, please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## AWS Services Supported

This alpha SDK currently does not provide support for every AWS service. You can see all the services currently supported on [AWS_SERVICES_SUPPORTED](AWS_SERVICES_SUPPORTED.md)

## Supported Rust Versions (MSRV)

The SDK currently requires a minimum of Rust 1.52.1, and is not guaranteed to build on compiler versions earlier than that. While we are still in alpha, we will be keeping the minimum compiler version two releases behind the latest stable release where possible (so if the latest stable is 1.55, we will be on 1.53). However, we are not making any guarantees around this at present. Increases in minimum required Rust version will be called out in the Release Notes for new releases of the SDK.

## Additional Resources

- Design docs - Design documentation for the SDK lives in the [design folder of smithy-rs](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/tree/main/design).
- Runtime / Handwritten code: The Rust Runtime code that underpins the SDK can be accessed [here](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/tree/main/rust-runtime) and [here](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/tree/main/aws/rust-runtime). This code is copied into this repo as part of code generation.
