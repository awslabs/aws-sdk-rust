# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Data Service

## Purpose

These code examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon Relational Database Service Data Service (Data Service) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

The Data Service (Data Service) provides a secure HTTP endpoint and integration with AWS SDKs so you can SQL statements without managing connections.

## Code examples

- [Query a cluster](src/bin/rdsdata-helloworld.rs) ()

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

## rdsdata-helloworld

This code example sends a query to an Aurora serverless cluster.

### Usage

```cargo run --bin rdsdata-helloworld -- -q QUERY -c CLUSTER_ARN -s SECRET_ARN [-r REGION] [-v]```

where:

- _QUERY_ is the query to send to the cluster.
- _CLUSTER_ARN_ is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.
- _SECRET_ARN_ is the ARN of the of the Secrets Manager secret.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to **us-west-2**.
- __-v__ enables displaying additional information.
