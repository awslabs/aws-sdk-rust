# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for MediaPackage

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Elemental MediaPackage (MediaPackage) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

MediaPackage is a just-in-time video packaging and origination service that delivers highly secure, scalable, and reliable video streams to a wide variety of playback devices.

## Code examples

- [Displays endpoint descriptions and URLs](src/bin/list-endpoints.rs) (ListOriginEndpoints)
- [Displays channel ARNs and descriptions](src/bin/mediapackage-helloworld.rs) (ListChannels)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### list-endpoints

This example lists your MediaPackage endpoint descriptions and URLs in the Region.

`cargo run --bin list-endpoints [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### mediapackage-helloworld

This example lists your MediaPackage channel ARNs and descriptions in the Region.

`cargo run --bin mediapackage-helloworld [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.
