# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Amazon Cognito user pools

## Purpose

This code example demonstrate how to perform an Amazon Cognito user pool operation using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Amazon Cognito user pools enable you to sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito.

## Code examples

- [List user pools](src/bin/list-user-pools.rs) (ListUserPools)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### list-user-pools

This example lists your Amazon Cognito user pools in the Region.

`cargo run --bin list-user-pools -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _DEFAULT-REGION_ is name of the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.
