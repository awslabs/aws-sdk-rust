# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Amazon S3

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

- [Copies an object from one bucket to another](src/bin/copy-object.rs) (CopyObject)
- [Create a bucket](src/bin/create-bucket.rs) (CreateBucket)
- [Delete an object from a bucket](src/bin/delete-object.rs) (DeleteObject)
- [Deletes one or more objects from a bucket](src/bin/delete-objects.rs) (DeleteObjects)
- [Gets a presigned URI for an object](src/bin/get-object-presigned.rs) (GetObject)
- [Lists your buckets](src/bin/list-buckets.rs) (ListBuckets)
- [Lists the objects in a bucket](src/bin/list-objects.rs) (ListObjectsV2)
- [Lists the versions of the objects in a bucket](src/bin/list-object-versions.rs) (ListObjectVersions)
- [Adds an object to a bucket and returns a public URI to the object.](src/bin/put-object-presigned.rs) (PutObject)
- [Lists your buckets and uploads a file to a bucket](src/bin/s3-helloworld.rs) (ListBuckets, PutObject)
- [Lists your buckets at a specified endpoint](src/bin/s3-object-lambda.rs) (ListBuckets)
- [Uses an SQL expression to retrieve content from an object in a bucket](src/bin/select-object-content.rs) (SelectObjectContent)

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### client

This example creates a basic client and lists your Amazon S3 buckets.

`cargo run --bin client -- [-r REGION] [-v]`
