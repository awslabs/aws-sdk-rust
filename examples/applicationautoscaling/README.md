# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Application Auto Scaling

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Application Auto Scaling (Application Auto Scaling) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Application Auto Scaling enables auto scaling for resources beyond just EC2, either with scaling policies or with scheduled scaling.

## Code examples

- [Lists your Application Auto Scaling policies](src/bin/describe-scaling-policies.rs) (DescribeScalingPolicies)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### describe-scaling-policies

This example lists your Application Auto Scaling policies in the Region.

`cargo run --bin describe-scaling-policies -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is name of the Region where the stacks are located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
