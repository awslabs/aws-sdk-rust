# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for AWS Step Functions

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Step Functions operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

AWS Step Functions is a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. Workflows manage failures, retries, parallelization, service integrations, and observability so developers can focus on higher-value business logic.

## Code examples

- [Start execution](src/bin/start-execution.rs)
- [Stop execution](src/bin/stop-execution.rs)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.


### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).
You must create an [AWS Step Functions definition](https://serverlessland.com/patterns?services=sfn)

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, 
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
