# AWS SDK for Rust code examples

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [Getting started with the AWS SDK for Rust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

See the individual readme files in each service directory for information about specific code examples for that service.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team,

The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
