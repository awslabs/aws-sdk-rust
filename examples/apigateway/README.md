# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway (API Gateway) enables you to create and deploy your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. You can create robust, secure, and scalable APIs that access Amazon Web Services or other web services, as well as data thatâ€™s stored in the AWS Cloud.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several API Gateway operations using the alpha version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

## Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

## Running the code

### get_rest_apis

This example describes the API Gateway REST APIs in the Region.

`cargo run --bin get_rest_apis -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is name of the Region where the stacks are located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### Notes

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
