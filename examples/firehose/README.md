# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Kinesis Data Firehose

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon Kinesis Firehose operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data to data lakes, data stores, and analytics services.

## Code examples

- [put_record_batch](src/bin/put-records-batch.rs) (PutRecordsBatch)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).


## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### put-records-batch

This example assumes a role and displays the user ID, Account and Arn. 

`cargo run --bin put-record-batch -- --firehose-stream STREAM-NAME [-r Region] [-v]`

Where:

- _STREAM-NAME_ is the name of the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to send the data to.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, 
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
