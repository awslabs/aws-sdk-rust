# Testing AWS SDK for Rust code examples

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to create an integration test for an SDK for Rust
operation. It uses the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) ListObjectsV2
operation to accumulate the size, in bytes, of objects in a bucket with a
specified prefix, and shows how to mock the call using traits or an enum.

## Code example

- [Get object sizes mocked by enum](src/enums.rs) (ListObjectsV2)
- [Get object sizes](src/intro.rs) (ListObjectsV2)
- [Get object sizes mocked by trait](src/traits.rs) (ListObjectsV2)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code example

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### intro

This example gets the accumulated size, in bytes, of the objects with a specified prefix in a bucket.

`cargo run -- -b BUCKET -p PREFIX [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket.
- _PREFIX_ is the first part of the bucket name.
- _REGION_ is name of the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to **us-west-2**.
- **-v** displays additional information.

## Running the unit tests

There are four unit tests, two with the same name in `enums.rs` and two in `traits.rs`.

You can run all of the tests with the following command:

`cargo test`

The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
