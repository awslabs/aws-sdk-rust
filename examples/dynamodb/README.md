# Rust code examples for DynamoDB

## Overview

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon DynamoDB (DynamoDB) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.
Most use the schema defined in the **create-table** example.

DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale.
DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools.

## ⚠ Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

- [Create a table, add some items from a file to the table, query the table, and delete the table](src/bin/movies.rs) (CreateTable, DeleteTable, ListTables, PutItem, Query)
  - To run this example, you should replace the `moviedata.json` file with the [DynamoDB Movies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/samples/moviedata.zip) zip database.
  - On a \*nix environment with bash, you can use the following command. (Be sure to run it from the same directory as this README.)
    `curl https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/samples/moviedata.zip > moviedata.zip ; unzip moviedata.zip ; rm moviedata.zip `

## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

These examples run with the Rust minimum compiler version as supported by the Rust SDK; at the time of this writing, that is Rust 1.61.0. Executables can run from cargo with additional command line arguments documented below and in the binary main functions.

## Run the code

### add-item

This example adds a new item to the specified table.

`cargo run --bin add-item -- -t TABLE -u USERNAME -p PERMISSION-TYPE -a AGE -f FIRST-NAME -l LAST-NAME [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _TABLE_ is the name of the table to which the item is added.
- _USERNAME_ is the username of the user to add to the table. This is the key index to the table.
- _PERMISSION-TYPE_ is the type of user, either "standard_user" or "admin".
- _AGE_ is the age of the user.
- _FIRST-NAME_ is the first name of the user.
- _LAST-NAME_ is the last name of the user.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as **us-east-1**, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to **us-west-2**.
- **-v** displays additional information.

and if there are more tables, displays "There are more tables".

`cargo run --bin are-more-tables -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as **us-east-1**, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to **us-west-2**.
- **-v** displays additional information.

### create-table

This example creates a table.
Use **delete-table** to delete the table you've created.

`cargo run --bin create-table -- -t TABLE -k KEY [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _TABLE_ is the name of the table to which the item is added.
- _KEY_ is the primary key for the table.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as **us-east-1**, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to **us-west-2**.
- **-v** displays additional information.

### crud

This example creates a table, adds an item to the table, updates the item, deletes the item, and deletes the table.

`cargo run --bin crud -- [-i] [-r REGION] [-v]`

- **-i** enables interactive mode, which pauses the code between operations.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as **us-east-1**, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the **AWS_REGION** environment variable.
