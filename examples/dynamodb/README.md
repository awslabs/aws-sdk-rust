# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Amazon DynamoDB

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon DynamoDB (DynamoDB) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.
Most use the schema defined in the __create-table__ example.

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

## Running the code

### add-item

This example adds a new item to the specified table.

`cargo run --bin add-item -- -t TABLE -u USERNAME -p PERMISSION-TYPE -a AGE -f FIRST-NAME -l LAST-NAME [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _TABLE_ is the name of the table to which the item is added.

- _LAST-NAME_ is the last name of the user.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as __us-east-1__, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### are-more-tables

This example lists up to 10 tables,
and if there are more tables, displays "There are more tables".

`cargo run --bin are-more-tables -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as __us-east-1__, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### create-table

This example creates a table.
Use __delete-table__ to delete the table you've created.

`cargo run --bin create-table -- -t TABLE -k KEY [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _TABLE_ is the name of the table to which the item is added.
- _KEY_ is the primary key for the table.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as __us-east-1__, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### crud

This example creates a table, adds an item to the table, updates the item, deletes the item, and deletes the table.

`cargo run --bin crud -- [-i] [-r REGION] [-v]`

- __-i__ enables interactive mode, which pauses the code between operations.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as __us-east-1__, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### delete-item

This example deletes an item from a DynamoDB table.

`cargo run --bin delete-item -- -t TABLE -k KEY -v VALUE [-r REGION] [-i]`

- _TABLE_ is the name of the table containing the item to delete.
- _KEY_ is the name of the primary key of the item to delete.
- _VALUE_ is the value of the primary key of the item to delete.
- _REGION_ is name of the AWS Region, such as __us-east-1__, where the table is located.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-i__ displays additional information.

### delete-table

Use __delete-table__ to delete __test-table__.

`cargo run --bin dynamodb-helloworld`

### list10-tables

This example lists up to 10 of your DynamoDB tables.

`cargo run --bin list10-tables -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

### list-tables-local

This example lists your DynamoDB tables using LocalStack.

`cargo run --bin list-tables-local`
