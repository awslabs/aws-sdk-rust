# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for AWS Batch 

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Batch operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.

## Code examples

- [List batch compute environments](src/bin/batch-helloworld.rs) (DescribeComputeEnvironments)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### batch-helloworld

This example lists the names and the ARNs of your AWS Batch compute environments in the Region.

`cargo run --bin batch-helloworld -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is name of the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, 
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
