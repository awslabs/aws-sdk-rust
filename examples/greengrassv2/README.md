# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for AWS IoT Greengrass V2

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several AWS Greengrass V2 operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. 

## Code examples

- [List your core devices](src/bin/list-core-devices.rs) (ListCoreDevices)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### list-core-devices

This example lists the name, status, and last update timestamp of your IoT Greengrass V2 devices in the Region. 

`cargo run --bin list-core-devices -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
