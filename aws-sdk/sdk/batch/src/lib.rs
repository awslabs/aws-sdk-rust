//! <fullname>Batch</fullname>
//! <p>Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
//! developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of
//! this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
//! infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
//! advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively
//! helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.</p>
//! <p>As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically
//! provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
//! workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
//! your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/batch).
