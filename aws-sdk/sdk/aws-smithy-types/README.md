# Fundamental Types for Smithy Services

This crate implements fundmental types shared across all service clients generated
by [smithy-rs](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs). Generally, you should not need to take a direct dependency on this
crate as service clients should publicly re-export the types when used.
