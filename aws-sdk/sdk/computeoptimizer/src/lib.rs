//! <p>Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization
//! metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as Amazon EC2
//! instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS volumes. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates
//! optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your
//! workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in addition
//! to projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to
//! evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The
//! analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running
//! resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more
//! information about Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to use the
//! service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/">Compute Optimizer User Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
