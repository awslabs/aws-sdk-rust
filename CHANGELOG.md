v0.0.26-alpha (November 23rd, 2021)
===================================

**Breaking Changes**
- `RetryConfigBuilder::merge_with` has been renamed to `RetryConfigBuilder::take_unset_from`
- `Credentials::from_keys` is now behind a feature flag named `hardcoded-credentials` in `aws-types`.
  It is __NOT__ secure to hardcode credentials into your application, and the credentials
  providers that come with the AWS SDK should be preferred. (smithy-rs#875, smithy-rs#317)
- (aws-smithy-client): Extraneous `pub use SdkSuccess` removed from `aws_smithy_client::hyper_ext`. (smithy-rs#855)
- The `add_metadata` function was removed from `AwsUserAgent` in `aws-http`.
  Use `with_feature_metadata`, `with_config_metadata`, or `with_framework_metadata` now instead. (smithy-rs#865)
- Several breaking changes around `aws_smithy_types::Instant` were introduced by smithy-rs#849:
  - `aws_smithy_types::Instant` from was renamed to `DateTime` to avoid confusion with the standard library's monotonically nondecreasing `Instant` type.
  - `DateParseError` in `aws_smithy_types` has been renamed to `DateTimeParseError` to match the type that's being parsed.
  - The `chrono-conversions` feature and associated functions have been moved to the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate.
    - Calls to `Instant::from_chrono` should be changed to:
      ```rust
      use aws_smithy_types::DateTime;
      use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

      // For chrono::DateTime<Utc>
      let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_utc(chrono_date_time);
      // For chrono::DateTime<FixedOffset>
      let date_time = DateTime::from_chrono_offset(chrono_date_time);
      ```
    - Calls to `instant.to_chrono()` should be changed to:
      ```rust
      use aws_smithy_types_convert::date_time::DateTimeExt;

      date_time.to_chrono_utc();
      ```
  - `Instant::from_system_time` and `Instant::to_system_time` have been changed to `From` trait implementations.
    - Calls to `from_system_time` should be changed to:
      ```rust
      DateTime::from(system_time);
      // or
      let date_time: DateTime = system_time.into();
      ```
    - Calls to `to_system_time` should be changed to:
      ```rust
      SystemTime::from(date_time);
      // or
      let system_time: SystemTime = date_time.into();
      ```
  - Several functions in `Instant`/`DateTime` were renamed:
    - `Instant::from_f64` -> `DateTime::from_secs_f64`
    - `Instant::from_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_fractional_secs`
    - `Instant::from_epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::from_secs`
    - `Instant::from_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::from_millis`
    - `Instant::epoch_fractional_seconds` -> `DateTime::as_secs_f64`
    - `Instant::has_nanos` -> `DateTime::has_subsec_nanos`
    - `Instant::epoch_seconds` -> `DateTime::secs`
    - `Instant::epoch_subsecond_nanos` -> `DateTime::subsec_nanos`
    - `Instant::to_epoch_millis` -> `DateTime::to_millis`
  - The `DateTime::fmt` method is now fallible and fails when a `DateTime`'s value is outside what can be represented by the desired date format.

**New this week**

- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.53.0 to 1.54.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- Conversions from `aws_smithy_types::DateTime` to `OffsetDateTime` from the `time` crate are now available from the `aws-smithy-types-convert` crate. (smithy-rs#849)
- Fixed links to Usage Examples (smithy-rs#862, @floric)
- Added missing features to user agent formatting, and made it possible to configure an app name for the user agent via service config. (smithy-rs#865)
- :bug: Relaxed profile name validation to allow `@` and other characters (smithy-rs#861, aws-sdk-rust#270)
- :bug: Fixed signing problem with S3 Control (smithy-rs#858, aws-sd-rust#291)
- :tada: Timeouts for requests are now configurable. You can set a timeout for each individual request attempt or for all attempts made for a request. (smithy-rs#831)
  - `SdkError` now includes a variant `TimeoutError` for when a request times out  (smithy-rs#885)
- Improve docs on `aws-smithy-client` (smithy-rs#855)
- Fix http-body dependency version (smithy-rs#883, aws-sdk-rust#305)

v0.0.25-alpha (November 11th, 2021)
===================================

No changes since last release except for version bumping since older versions
of the AWS SDK were failing to compile with the `0.27.0-alpha.2` version chosen
for some of the supporting crates.

v0.0.24-alpha (November 9th, 2021)
==================================
**Breaking Changes**
- Members named `builder` on model structs were renamed to `builder_value` so that their accessors don't conflict with the existing `builder()` methods (smithy-rs#842)

**New this week**
- Fix epoch seconds date-time parsing bug in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)
- Omit trailing zeros from fraction when formatting HTTP dates in `aws-smithy-types` (smithy-rs#834)
- Moved examples into repository root (aws-sdk-rust#181, smithy-rs#843)
- Model structs now have accessor methods for their members. We recommend updating code to use accessors instead of public fields. A future release will deprecate the public fields before they are made private. (smithy-rs#842)
- :bug: Fix bug that caused signing to fail for requests where the body length was <=9. (smithy-rs#845)

v0.0.23-alpha (November 3rd, 2021)
==================================
**New this week**
- :tada: Add support for AWS Glacier (smithy-rs#801)
- :tada: Add support for AWS Panorama
- :bug: Fix `native-tls` feature in `aws-config` (aws-sdk-rust#265, smithy-rs#803)
- Add example to aws-sig-auth for generating an IAM Token for RDS (smithy-rs#811, aws-sdk-rust#147)
- :bug: `hyper::Error(IncompleteMessage)` will now be retried (smithy-rs#815)
- :bug: S3 request metadata signing now correctly trims headers fixing [problems like this](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/248) (smithy-rs#761)
- All unions (eg. `dynamodb::model::AttributeValue`) now include an additional `Unknown` variant. These support cases where a new union variant has been added on the server but the client has not been updated.
- :bug: Fix generated docs on unions like `dynamodb::AttributeValue`. (smithy-rs#826)

**Breaking Changes**
- `<operation>.make_operation(&config)` is now an `async` function for all operations. Code should be updated to call `.await`. This will only impact users using the low-level API. (smithy-rs#797)

v0.0.22-alpha (October 20th, 2021)
==================================

**Breaking Changes**

- `CredentialsError` variants became non-exhaustive. This makes them impossible to construct directly outside of the `aws_types` crate. In order to construct credentials errors, new methods have been added for each variant. Instead of `CredentialsError::Unhandled(...)`, you should instead use `CredentialsError::unhandled`. Matching methods exist for all variants. (#781)
- The default credentials chain now returns `CredentialsError::CredentialsNotLoaded` instead of `ProviderError` when no credentials providers are configured.
- :warning: All Smithy runtime crates have been renamed to have an `aws-` prefix. This may require code changes:
  - _Cargo.toml_ changes:
    - `smithy-async` -> `aws-smithy-async`
    - `smithy-client` -> `aws-smithy-client`
    - `smithy-eventstream` -> `aws-smithy-eventstream`
    - `smithy-http` -> `aws-smithy-http`
    - `smithy-http-tower` -> `aws-smithy-http-tower`

    - `smithy-query` -> `aws-smithy-query`
    - `smithy-types` -> `aws-smithy-types`
    - `smithy-xml` -> `aws-smithy-xml`
  - Rust `use` statement changes:
    - `smithy_async` -> `aws_smithy_async`
    - `smithy_client` -> `aws_smithy_client`
    - `smithy_eventstream` -> `aws_smithy_eventstream`
    - `smithy_http` -> `aws_smithy_http`
    - `smithy_http_tower` -> `aws_smithy_http_tower`
    - `smithy_json` -> `aws_smithy_json`
    - `smithy_protocol_test` -> `aws_smithy_protocol_test`
    - `smithy_query` -> `aws_smithy_query`
    - `smithy_types` -> `aws_smithy_types`
    - `smithy_xml` -> `aws_smithy_xml`

**New this week**

- Moved the contents of `aws-auth` into the `aws-http` runtime crate (smithy-rs#783)
- Fix instances where docs were missing in generated services and add `#[warn_missing_docs]` (smithy-rs#779)

- Add support for the following Glacier customizations:
  - Set the ApiVersion header (smithy-rs#138, #787)

v0.0.21-alpha (October 15th, 2021)
==================================

**New this week**

- Prepare crate manifests for publishing to crates.io (smithy-rs#755)
- Add support for IAM Roles for tasks credential provider (smithy-rs#765, aws-sdk-rust#123)
- All service crates now have generated README files (smithy-rs#766)
- Update AWS service models (smithy-rs#772)
- :tada: Add support for Amazon Managed Grafana (smithy-rs#772)

v0.0.20-alpha (October 7, 2021)
===============================

**Breaking changes**

- :warning: MSRV increased from 1.52.1 to 1.53.0 per our 3-behind MSRV policy.
- `SmithyConnector` and `DynConnector` now return `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>`. If you have written a custom connector, it will need to be updated to return the new error type. (#744)
- The `DispatchError` variant of `SdkError` now contains `ConnectorError` instead of `Box<dyn Error>` (#744).

**New This Week**

- :tada: Make retry behavior configurable
    - With env vars `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `AWS_RETRY_MODE`
    - With `~/.aws/config` settings `max_attempts` and `retry_mode`
    - By calling the `with_retry_config` method on a `Config` and passing in a `RetryConfig`

**Contributions**

Thank you for your contributions! :heart:

- @jonhoo (smithy-rs#703)

v0.0.18-alpha (September 14th, 2021)
=======================

- :tada: Add support for `OpenSearch` service & bring in other model updates (#todo)
- Cleanup docs in `aws-config`

**New This Week**
- :bug: Fixes issue where `Content-Length` header could be duplicated leading to signing failure (aws-sdk-rust#220, smithy-rs#697)

v0.0.17-alpha (September 2nd, 2021)
===================================

This release adds support for three commonly requested features:
- More powerful credential chain
- Support for constructing multiple clients from the same configuration
- Support for Transcribe streaming and S3 Select

In addition, this overhauls client configuration which lead to a number of breaking changes. Detailed changes are inline.

Current Credential Provider Support:
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] Web Identity Token Credentials
- [ ] Profile file support (partial)
  - [ ] Credentials
    - [ ] SSO
    - [ ] ECS Credential source
    - [ ] IMDS credential source
    - [x] Assume role from source profile
    - [x] Static credentials source profile
    - [x] WebTokenIdentity provider
  - [x] Region
- [ ] IMDS
- [ ] ECS

Upgrade Guide
-------------

### If you use `<sdk>::Client::from_env`

`from_env` loaded region & credentials from environment variables _only_. Default sources have been removed from the generated
SDK clients and moved to the `aws-config` package. Note that the `aws-config` package default chain adds support for
profile file and web identity token profiles.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
2. Update your client creation code:
   ```rust
   // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
   let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
   // before: <service>::Client::from_env();
   let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   ```

### If you used `<client>::Config::builder()`

`Config::build()` has been modified to _not_ fallback to a default provider. Instead, use `aws-config` to load and modify
the default chain. Note that when you switch to `aws-config`, support for profile files and web identity tokens will be added.

1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```

2. Update your client creation code:

   ```rust
   fn before() {
     let region = aws_types::region::ChainProvider::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     let config = <service>::Config::builder().region(region).build();
     let client = <service>::Client::from_conf(&config);
   }

   async fn after() {
     use aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain;
     let region_provider = RegionProviderChain::first_try(<1 provider>).or_default_provider();
     // `shared_config` can be used to construct multiple different service clients!
     let shared_config = aws_config::from_env().region(region_provider).load().await;
     let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config)
   }
   ```

### If you used `aws-auth-providers`
All credential providers that were in `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config`. Unless you have a specific use case
for a specific credential provider, you should use the default provider chain:

```rust
 let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
 let client = <service>::Client::new(&shared_config);
```

### If you maintain your own credential provider

`AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The trait has been moved from `aws-auth` to `aws-types`.
The original `ProvideCredentials` trait has been removed. The return type has been changed to by a custom future.

For synchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomCreds;
impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    // if your credentials are synchronous, use `::ready`
    // if your credentials are loaded asynchronously, use `::new`
    future::ProvideCredentials::ready(todo!()) // your credentials go here
  }
}
```

For asynchronous use cases:
```rust
use aws_types::credentials::{ProvideCredentials, future, Result};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomAsyncCreds;
impl CustomAsyncCreds {
  async fn load_credentials(&self) -> Result {
    Ok(Credentials::from_keys("my creds...", "secret", None))
  }
}

impl ProvideCredentials for CustomCreds {
  fn provide_credentials<'a>(&'a self) -> future::ProvideCredentials<'a>
    where
            Self: 'a,
  {
    future::ProvideCredentials::new(self.load_credentials())
  }
}
```

Changes
-------

**Breaking Changes**

- Credential providers from `aws-auth-providers` have been moved to `aws-config` (smithy-rs#678)
- `AsyncProvideCredentials` has been renamed to `ProvideCredentials`. The original non-async provide credentials has been
  removed. See the migration guide above.
- `<sevicename>::from_env()` has been removed (#675). A drop-in replacement is available:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. Update your client creation code:
     ```rust
     let client = <service>>::Client::new(&aws_config::load_from_env().await)
     ```

- `ProvideRegion` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::ProvideRegion`. (smithy-rs#675)
- `aws_types::region::ChainProvider` has been moved to `aws_config::meta::region::RegionProviderChain` (smithy-rs#675).
- `ProvideRegion` is now asynchronous. Code that called `provider.region()` must be changed to `provider.region().await`.
- `<awsservice>::Config::builder()` will **not** load a default region. To preserve previous behavior:
  1. Add a dependency on `aws-config`:
     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     aws-config = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.17-alpha" }
     ```
  2. ```rust
     let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
     let config = <service>::config::Builder::from(&shared_config).<other builder modifications>.build();
     ```

v0.0.16-alpha (August 19th, 2021)
=================================

**New This Week**

- :tada: Add Chime Identity, Chime Messaging, and Snow Device Management support (smithy-rs#657)
- :tada: Add profile file credential provider implementation. This implementation currently does not support credential sources for assume role providers other than environment variables. (smithy-rs#640)
- :tada: Add support for WebIdentityToken providers via profile & environment variables. (smithy-rs#654)
- :bug: Fix name collision that occurred when a model had both a union and a structure named `Result` (smithy-rs#643)
- :bug: Fix STS Assume Role with WebIdentity & Assume role with SAML to support clients with no credentials provided (smithy-rs#652)
- Update AWS SDK models (smithy-rs#657)
- Add initial implementation of a default provider chain. (smithy-rs#650)

v0.0.15-alpha (August 11th, 2021)
=================================

This release primarily contains internal changes to runtime components & updates to AWS models.

**Breaking changes**

- (smithy-rs#635) The `config()`, `config_mut()`, `request()`, and `request_mut()` methods on `operation::Request` have been renamed to `properties()`, `properties_mut()`, `http()`, and `http_mut()` respectively.
- (smithy-rs#635) The `Response` type on Tower middleware has been changed from `http::Response<SdkBody>` to `operation::Response`. The HTTP response is still available from the `operation::Response` using its `http()` and `http_mut()` methods.
- (smithy-rs#635) The `ParseHttpResponse` trait's `parse_unloaded()` method now takes an `operation::Response` rather than an `http::Response<SdkBody>`.
- (smithy-rs#626) `ParseHttpResponse` no longer has a generic argument for the body type, but instead, always uses `SdkBody`. This may cause compilation failures for you if you are using Smithy generated types to parse JSON or XML without using a client to request data from a service. The fix should be as simple as removing `<SdkBody>` in the example below:

  Before:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse<SdkBody>>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

  After:
  ```rust
  let output = <Query as ParseHttpResponse>::parse_loaded(&parser, &response).unwrap();
  ```

**New This Week**

- The closure passed to `async_provide_credentials_fn` can now borrow values (smithy-rs#637)
- Bring in the latest AWS models (smithy-rs#630)

v0.0.14-alpha (July 28th, 2021)
===============================

IoT Data Plane is now available! If you discover it isn't functioning as expected, please let us know!

This week also sees the addition of a robust async caching credentials provider. Take a look at the [STS example](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs/blob/7fa4af4a9367aeca6d55e26fc4d4ba93093b90c4/aws/sdk/examples/sts/src/bin/credentials-provider.rs) to see how to use it.

To upgrade to the new release, update `tag` to `v0.0.14-alpha`:
```
[dependencies]
# e.g. S3:
aws-sdk-s3 = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust", tag = "v0.0.14-alpha" }
```

**New This Week**

- :tada: Add IoT Data Plane (smithy-rs#624)
- :tada: Add LazyCachingCredentialsProvider to aws-auth for use with expiring credentials, such as STS AssumeRole. Update STS example to use this new provider (smithy-rs#578, smithy-rs#595)
- :bug: Correctly encode HTTP Checksums using base64 instead of hex. Fixes #164. (smithy-rs#615)
- Overhaul serialization/deserialization of numeric/boolean types. This resolves issues around serialization of NaN/Infinity and should also reduce the number of allocations required during serialization. (smithy-rs#618)
- Update SQS example to clarify usage of FIFO vs. standard queues (#162, @trevorrobertsjr)

**Contributions**

Thank you for your contributions! :heart:

- @trevorrobertsjr (#622)


v0.0.13-alpha (July 28th, 2021)
===============================

:tada: This week's release includes most of the remaining AWS services (269 in total!).

**Breaking changes**
- `test-util` has been made an optional dependency and has moved from
  aws-hyper to smithy-http. If you were relying on `aws_hyper::TestConnection`, add `smithy-client` as a dependency
  and enable the optional `test-util` feature. This prunes some unnecessary dependencies on `roxmltree` and `serde_json`
  for most users. (smithy-rs#608)

**New This Week**
- :tada: Release all but four remaining AWS services! Glacier, IoT Data Plane, Timestream DB and Transcribe Streaming will be available in a future release. If you discover that a service isn't functioning as expected please let us know! (smithy-rs#607)
- :bug: Bugfix: Fix parsing bug where parsing XML incorrectly stripped whitespace (smithy-rs#590, #153)
- We now run some tests on Windows (smithy-rs#594)
- :bug: Bugfix: Constrain RFC-3339 timestamp formatting to microsecond precision (smithy-rs#596, #152)


v0.0.12-alpha (July 19th, 2021)
===============================

This week we've added Autoscaling and fixed an S3 bug.

To update to the new release, change your tag to v0.0.12-alpha.

**New this Week**
- :tada: Add support for Autoscaling (#576, #582)
- `AsyncProvideCredentials` now introduces an additional lifetime parameter, simplifying bridging it with `#[async_trait]` interfaces
- Fix S3 bug when content type was set explicitly (aws-sdk-rust#131, #566, @eagletmt)

v0.0.11-alpha (July 6th, 2021)
==============================

This week, we've added AWS Config, EBS, Cognito, and Snowball. Projects that are implementing the `ProvideCredentials` trait will need to update their imports and should consider using the new `async_provide_credentials_fn` for async credential use-cases.

To update to the new release, change your tag to `v0.0.11-alpha`.
