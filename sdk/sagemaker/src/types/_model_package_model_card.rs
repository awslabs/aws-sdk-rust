/// <p>The model card associated with the model package. Since <code>ModelPackageModelCard</code> is tied to a model package, it is a specific usage of a model card and its schema is simplified compared to the schema of <code>ModelCard</code>. The <code>ModelPackageModelCard</code> schema does not include <code>model_package_details</code>, and <code>model_overview</code> is composed of the <code>model_creator</code> and <code>model_artifact</code> properties. For more information about the model card associated with the model package, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html">View the Details of a Model Version</a>.</p>
