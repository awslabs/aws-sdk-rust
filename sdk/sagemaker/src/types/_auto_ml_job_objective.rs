    /// <p>The area under the curve (AUC) metric is used to compare and evaluate binary classification by algorithms that return probabilities, such as logistic regression. To map the probabilities into classifications, these are compared against a threshold value. </p>
    /// <p>The relevant curve is the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) of predictions (or recall) against the false positive rate (FPR) as a function of the threshold value, above which a prediction is considered positive. Increasing the threshold results in fewer false positives, but more false negatives. </p>
    /// <p>AUC is the area under this ROC curve. Therefore, AUC provides an aggregated measure of the model performance across all possible classification thresholds. AUC scores vary between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, and a score of one half (0.5) indicates that the prediction is not better than a random classifier. </p>
