/// <p>Specifies a limit to how long a model training job or model compilation job can run. It also specifies how long a managed spot training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs.</p>
/// <p>To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. </p>
/// <p>The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with <code>CreateModel</code>.</p> <note>
/// <p>The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete.</p>
