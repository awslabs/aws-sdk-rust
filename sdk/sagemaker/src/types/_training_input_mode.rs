/// When writing a match expression against `TrainingInputMode`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let traininginputmode = unimplemented!();
/// match traininginputmode {
///     TrainingInputMode::Fastfile => { /* ... */ },
///     TrainingInputMode::File => { /* ... */ },
///     TrainingInputMode::Pipe => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `traininginputmode` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `TrainingInputMode::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `TrainingInputMode::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `TrainingInputMode::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `traininginputmode` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `TrainingInputMode::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// <p>The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more information about input
/// modes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html">Algorithms</a>.</p>
/// <p>
/// <b>Pipe mode</b>
/// </p>
/// <p>If an algorithm supports <code>Pipe</code> mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from
/// Amazon S3 to the container.</p>
/// <p>
/// <b>File mode</b>
/// </p>
/// <p>If an algorithm supports <code>File</code> mode, SageMaker downloads the training data from
/// S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker volume
/// for the training container.</p>
/// <p>You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate the
/// data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also
/// stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also
/// store intermediate information, if any.</p>
/// <p>For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your training
/// duration is predictable if the input data objects sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker
/// does not split the files any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
/// training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed when one host in a
/// training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.</p>
/// <p>
/// <b>FastFile mode</b>
/// </p>
/// <p>If an algorithm supports <code>FastFile</code> mode, SageMaker streams data directly from
/// S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides file system access to the data.
/// Users can author their training script to interact with these files as if they were
/// stored on disk.</p>
/// <p>
/// <code>FastFile</code> mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented
/// manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is lower when there are fewer files in
/// the S3 bucket provided.</p>
