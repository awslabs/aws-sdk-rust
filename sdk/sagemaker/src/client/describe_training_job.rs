It also specifies how long a managed Spot training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training job. Use this API to cap model training costs.</p>  <p>To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. </p>

You are billed for the time interval between this time and the value of <code>TrainingEndTime</code>. The start time in CloudWatch Logs might be later than this time. The difference is due to the time it takes to download the training data and to the size of the training container.</p>

    ///   - [`enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption(bool)`](crate::operation::describe_training_job::DescribeTrainingJobOutput::enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption): <p>To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in distributed training, choose <code>True</code>. Encryption provides greater security for distributed training, but training might take longer. How long it takes depends on the amount of communication between compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning algorithms in distributed training.</p>
    ///   - [`enable_managed_spot_training(bool)`](crate::operation::describe_training_job::DescribeTrainingJobOutput::enable_managed_spot_training): <p>A Boolean indicating whether managed spot training is enabled (<code>True</code>) or not (<code>False</code>).</p>
    ///   - [`checkpoint_config(Option<CheckpointConfig>)`](crate::operation::describe_training_job::DescribeTrainingJobOutput::checkpoint_config): <p>Contains information about the output location for managed spot training checkpoint data. </p>
    ///   - [`training_time_in_seconds(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::describe_training_job::DescribeTrainingJobOutput::training_time_in_seconds): <p>The training time in seconds.</p>

Billable time refers to the absolute wall-clock time.</p>  <p>Multiply <code>BillableTimeInSeconds</code> by the number of instances (<code>InstanceCount</code>) in your training cluster to get the total compute time SageMaker bills you if you run distributed training. The formula is as follows: <code>BillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount</code> .</p>  <p>You can calculate the savings from using managed spot training using the formula <code>(1 - BillableTimeInSeconds / TrainingTimeInSeconds) * 100</code>. For example, if <code>BillableTimeInSeconds</code> is 100 and <code>TrainingTimeInSeconds</code> is 500, the savings is 80%.</p>
