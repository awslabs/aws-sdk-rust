Do not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.</p>  <p>For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams correspond to Amazon Cognito <i>user groups</i> within the user pool used to create a workforce. All of the <code>CognitoMemberDefinition</code> objects that make up the member definition must have the same <code>ClientId</code> and <code>UserPool</code> values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing worker pool, see <code>Adding groups to a User Pool</code>. For more information about user pools, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">Amazon Cognito User Pools</a>.</p>  <p>For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups that you want to include in your private work team in <code>OidcMemberDefinition</code> by listing those groups in <code>Groups</code>.</p>
