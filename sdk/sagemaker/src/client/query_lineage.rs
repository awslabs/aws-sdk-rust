For example: <code>TrialComponent</code>, <code>Artifact</code>, or <code>Context</code>.</p> </li>   <li> <p>CreatedBefore - Filter entities created before this date.</p> </li>   <li> <p>ModifiedBefore - Filter entities modified before this date.</p> </li>   <li> <p>ModifiedAfter - Filter entities modified after this date.</p> </li>  </ul>
