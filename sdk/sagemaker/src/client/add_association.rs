Amazon SageMaker places no restrictions on their use.</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>ContributedTo - The source contributed to the destination or had a part in enabling the destination. For example, the training data contributed to the training job.</p> </li>   <li> <p>AssociatedWith - The source is connected to the destination. For example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment.</p> </li>   <li> <p>DerivedFrom - The destination is a modification of the source. For example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is derived from the original inputs.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Produced - The source generated the destination. For example, a training job produced a model artifact.</p> </li>  </ul>
