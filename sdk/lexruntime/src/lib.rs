//! <p>Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint
//! provides a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the
//! runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For
//! example, suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to
//! Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user
//! request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the
//! bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to
//! elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust
//! type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when
//! you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your
//! Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time
//! API, . </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
