# aws-sdk-pi

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.

When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.

DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-pi` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.55.0"
aws-sdk-pi = "0.25.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_pi as pi;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), pi::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = pi::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-pi/latest/aws_sdk_pi/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
