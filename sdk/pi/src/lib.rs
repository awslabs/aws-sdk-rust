//! <fullname>Amazon RDS Performance Insights</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide
//! provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.</p>
//! <p>When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the
//! authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.</p>
//! <p>DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension
//! provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested
//! dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
