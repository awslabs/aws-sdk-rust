# aws-sdk-ecrpublic

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ecrpublic` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.4.0"
aws-sdk-ecrpublic = "0.4.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
