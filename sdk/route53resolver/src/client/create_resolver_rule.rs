impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateResolverRule`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`creator_request_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::creator_request_id) / [`set_creator_request_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_creator_request_id): <p>A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. <code>CreatorRequestId</code> can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp. </p>
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_name): <p>A friendly name that lets you easily find a rule in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.</p>
    ///   - [`rule_type(RuleTypeOption)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::rule_type) / [`set_rule_type(Option<RuleTypeOption>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_rule_type): <p>When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify <code>FORWARD</code>.</p>  <p>When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify <code>SYSTEM</code>.</p>  <p>For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify <code>FORWARD</code> for <code>RuleType</code>. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify <code>SYSTEM</code> for <code>RuleType</code>.</p>  <p>Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of <code>RECURSIVE</code> for <code>RuleType</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`domain_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::domain_name) / [`set_domain_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_domain_name): <p>DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that you specify in <code>TargetIps</code>. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).</p>
    ///   - [`target_ips(Vec<TargetAddress>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::target_ips) / [`set_target_ips(Option<Vec<TargetAddress>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_target_ips): <p>The IPs that you want Resolver to forward DNS queries to. You can specify only IPv4 addresses. Separate IP addresses with a space.</p>  <p> <code>TargetIps</code> is available only when the value of <code>Rule type</code> is <code>FORWARD</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`resolver_endpoint_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::resolver_endpoint_id) / [`set_resolver_endpoint_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateResolverRule::set_resolver_endpoint_id): <p>The ID of the outbound Resolver endpoint that you want to use to route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in <code>TargetIps</code>.</p>
