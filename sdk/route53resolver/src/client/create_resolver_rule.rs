To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify <code>SYSTEM</code> for <code>RuleType</code>.</p>  <p>Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of <code>RECURSIVE</code> for <code>RuleType</code>.</p>

If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).</p>
