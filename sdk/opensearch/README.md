# aws-sdk-opensearch

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Use the Amazon OpenSearch configuration API to create, configure, and manage Amazon OpenSearch Service domains.

For sample code that uses the configuration API, see the [Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/opensearch-configuration-samples.html). The guide also contains [sample code for sending signed HTTP requests to the OpenSearch APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/request-signing.html).

The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific: es._region_.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#service-regions).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-opensearch` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.10.0"
aws-sdk-opensearch = "0.10.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
