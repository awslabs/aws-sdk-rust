    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeOutboundConnectionsOutput::next_token): <p>When <code>nextToken</code> is returned, there are more results available. The value of <code>nextToken</code> is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.</p>
