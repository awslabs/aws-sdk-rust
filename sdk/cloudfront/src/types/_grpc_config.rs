/// <p>Amazon CloudFront supports gRPC, an open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework built on HTTP/2. gRPC offers bi-directional streaming and binary protocol that buffers payloads, making it suitable for applications that require low latency communications.</p>
/// <p>To enable your distribution to handle gRPC requests, you must include HTTP/2 as one of the supported <code>HTTP</code> versions and allow <code>HTTP</code> methods, including <code>POST</code>.</p>
