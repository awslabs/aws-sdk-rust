# aws-sdk-sso

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

AWS Single Sign-On Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign user access to AWS SSO resources such as the user portal. Users can get AWS account applications and roles assigned to them and get federated into the application.

For general information about AWS SSO, see [What is AWS Single Sign-On?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the _AWS SSO User Guide_.

This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO Portal operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-sso` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.5.1"
aws-sdk-sso = "0.5.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
