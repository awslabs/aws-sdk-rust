//! <p>AWS Single Sign-On Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign user
//! access to AWS SSO resources such as the user portal. Users can get AWS account applications
//! and roles assigned to them and get federated into the application.</p>
//!
//! <p>For general information about AWS SSO, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS
//! Single Sign-On?</a> in the <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! <p>This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO Portal operations that you can call
//! programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p>
//!
//! <note>
//! <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
//! languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a
//! convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more
//! information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
//! </note>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
