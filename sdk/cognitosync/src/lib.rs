//! <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
//! application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and
//! Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if
//! the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device
//! to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
//! credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value
//! pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.</p>
//! <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to
//! credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need
//! to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Cognito Identity service</a>.</p>
//! <p>If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to
//! make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for Android</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for iOS</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/cognitosync).
