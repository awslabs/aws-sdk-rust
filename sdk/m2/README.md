# aws-sdk-m2

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon Web Services Mainframe Modernization provides tools and resources to help you plan and implement migration and modernization from mainframes to Amazon Web Services managed runtime environments. It provides tools for analyzing existing mainframe applications, developing or updating mainframe applications using COBOL or PL/I, and implementing an automated pipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of the applications.

## Getting Started

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-m2` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.14.0"
aws-sdk-m2 = "0.14.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
