This is documentation for __AWS CloudHSM Classic__. For more information, see [AWS CloudHSM Classic FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/faqs-classic/), the [AWS CloudHSM Classic User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/classic/userguide/), and the [AWS CloudHSM Classic API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/classic/APIReference/).

__For information about the current version of AWS CloudHSM__, see [AWS CloudHSM](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), the [AWS CloudHSM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/), and the [AWS CloudHSM API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-cloudhsm` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-cloudhsm = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_cloudhsm as cloudhsm;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), cloudhsm::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_cloudhsm::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-cloudhsm/latest/aws_sdk_cloudhsm/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
