/// <p>Deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The operation deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway virtual machine (VM) from your host computer.</p>
/// <p>After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however, pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete a gateway, your next step is to remove it from your environment.</p> <important>
/// <p>You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted; however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will continue to be billed for these snapshots.&nbsp;You can choose to remove all remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription.&nbsp; If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console.
