The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last time the gateway listed the folder's contents. If this value set to <code>true</code>, each folder that is listed in <code>FolderList</code> is recursively updated. Otherwise, subfolders listed in <code>FolderList</code> are not refreshed. Only objects that are in folders listed directly under <code>FolderList</code> are found and used for the update.
