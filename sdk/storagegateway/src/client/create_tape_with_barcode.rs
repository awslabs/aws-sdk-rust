Use the <code>ListGateways</code> operation to return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.</p>

The tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3 Glacier or S3 Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.</p>

Each tag is a key-value pair.</p> <note>   <p>Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.
