# aws-sdk-dsql

This is an interface reference for Amazon Aurora DSQL. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Aurora DSQL.

Amazon Aurora DSQL is a serverless, distributed SQL database suitable for workloads of any size. is available in both single-Region and multi-Region configurations, so your clusters and databases are always available even if an Availability Zone or an Amazon Web Services Region are unavailable. lets you focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-dsql` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-dsql = "1.42.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_dsql as dsql;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), dsql::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_dsql::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-dsql/latest/aws_sdk_dsql/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
