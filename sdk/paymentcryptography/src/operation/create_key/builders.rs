/// <p>Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and Amazon Web Services Region. You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and decryption.</p>
/// <p>In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key includes metadata such as the key ARN, key usage, key origin, creation date, description, and key state.</p>
/// <p>When you create a key, you specify both immutable and mutable data about the key. The immutable data contains key attributes that define the scope and cryptographic operations that you can perform using the key, for example key class (example: <code>SYMMETRIC_KEY</code>), key algorithm (example: <code>TDES_2KEY</code>), key usage (example: <code>TR31_P0_PIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY</code>) and key modes of use (example: <code>Encrypt</code>). For information about valid combinations of key attributes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-validattributes.html">Understanding key attributes</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide</i>. The mutable data contained within a key includes usage timestamp and key deletion timestamp and can be modified after creation.</p>
/// <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography binds key attributes to keys using key blocks when you store or export them. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography stores the key contents wrapped and never stores or transmits them in the clear.</p>
