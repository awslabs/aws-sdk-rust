description = "<p>The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB</p>\n         <note>\n            <p>Instead of interacting directly with this API, we recommend using the QLDB driver\n            or the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on a ledger.</p>\n            <ul>\n               <li>\n                  <p>If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The driver provides\n                  a high-level abstraction layer above this <i>QLDB Session</i> data\n                  plane and manages <code>SendCommand</code> API calls for you. For information and\n                  a list of supported programming languages, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html\">Getting started\n                     with the driver</a> in the <i>Amazon QLDB Developer\n                  Guide</i>.</p>\n               </li>\n               <li>\n                  <p>If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use the\n                  QLDB shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses the QLDB driver to\n                  interact with a ledger. For information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/data-shell.html\">Accessing Amazon QLDB using the\n                     QLDB shell</a>.</p>\n               </li>\n            </ul>\n         </note>"
