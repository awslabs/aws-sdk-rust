This is the same ID returned from <code>PollForJobs</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`current_revision(CurrentRevision)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutJobSuccessResult::current_revision) / [`set_current_revision(Option<CurrentRevision>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutJobSuccessResult::set_current_revision): <p>The ID of the current revision of the artifact successfully worked on by the job.</p>

Future jobs use this token to identify the running instance of the action. It can be reused to return more information about the progress of the custom action. When the action is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.</p>
