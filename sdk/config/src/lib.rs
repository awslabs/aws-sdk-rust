//! <fullname>Config</fullname>
//!
//! <p>Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations
//! of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can
//! use Config to get the current and historical configurations of
//! each Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship
//! between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute
//! Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an
//! elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete
//! list of resources currently supported by Config, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>
//!
//! <p>You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management
//! Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config
//! API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains
//! documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that
//! you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the
//! Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more
//! information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
//! Version 4 Signing Process</a>. For detailed information
//! about Config features and their associated actions or commands,
//! as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is Config</a> in the <i>Config Developer
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/config).
