/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutOrganizationConfigRule`.
/// 
/// <p>Adds or updates an Config rule for your entire organization to evaluate if your Amazon Web Services resources comply with your desired configurations. For information on how many organization Config rules you can have per account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html"> <b>Service Limits</b> </a> in the <i>Config Developer Guide</i>.</p> 
/// <p> Only a management account and a delegated administrator can create or update an organization Config rule. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations <code>ListDelegatedAdministrator</code> permissions are added. An organization can have up to 3 delegated administrators.</p> 
/// <p>This API enables organization service access through the <code>EnableAWSServiceAccess</code> action and creates a service-linked role <code>AWSServiceRoleForConfigMultiAccountSetup</code> in the management or delegated administrator account of your organization. The service-linked role is created only when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the existence of role with <code>GetRole</code> action.</p> 
/// <p>To use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated administrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization <code>register-delegated-administrator</code> for <code>config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com</code>. </p> 
/// <p>There are two types of rules: Config Custom Rules and Config Managed Rules. You can use <code>PutOrganizationConfigRule</code> to create both Config custom rules and Config managed rules.</p> 
/// <p>Custom rules are rules that you can create using either Guard or Lambda functions. Guard (<a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard">Guard GitHub Repository</a>) is a policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by Config Custom Policy rules. Lambda uses custom code that you upload to evaluate a custom rule. If you are adding a new Custom Lambda rule, you first need to create an Lambda function in the management account or a delegated administrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. You also need to create an IAM role in the managed account that can be assumed by the Lambda function. When you use <code>PutOrganizationConfigRule</code> to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function.</p> 
/// <p>Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list of managed rules, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html">List of Config Managed Rules</a>. If you are adding an Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the <code>RuleIdentifier</code> key.</p> <note> 
/// <p>Prerequisite: Ensure you call <code>EnableAllFeatures</code> API to enable all features in an organization.</p> 
/// <p>Make sure to specify one of either <code>OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMetadata</code> for Custom Policy rules, <code>OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata</code> for Custom Lambda rules, or <code>OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata</code> for managed rules.</p>
