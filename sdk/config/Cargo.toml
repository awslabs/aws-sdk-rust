description = "<fullname>AWS Config</fullname>\n\n\t\t       <p>AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations\n\t\t\tof all the AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can\n\t\t\tuse AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of\n\t\t\teach AWS resource and also to get information about the relationship\n\t\t\tbetween the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute\n\t\t\tCloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an\n\t\t\telastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete\n\t\t\tlist of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources\">Supported AWS Resources</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t       <p>You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management\n\t\t\tConsole, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config\n\t\t\tAPI, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config. This reference guide contains\n\t\t\tdocumentation for the AWS Config API and the AWS CLI commands that\n\t\t\tyou can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the\n\t\t\tSignature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more\n\t\t\tinformation about how to sign a request with this protocol, see\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature\n\t\t\t\tVersion 4 Signing Process</a>. For detailed information\n\t\t\tabout AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands,\n\t\t\tas well as how to work with AWS Management Console, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html\">What Is AWS\n\t\t\t\tConfig</a> in the <i>AWS Config Developer\n\t\t\t\tGuide</i>.</p>"
