# aws-sdk-glacier

Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."

Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.

Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Glacier.

If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the _Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide_:
  - [What is Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html) - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.
  - [Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html) - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-glacier` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-glacier = "0.0.0-local"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_glacier as glacier;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), glacier::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_glacier::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-glacier/latest/aws_sdk_glacier/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
