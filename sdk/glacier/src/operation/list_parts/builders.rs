/// <p>This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code>. List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range. </p> 
/// <p>The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check the response for a <code>marker</code> at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the <code>marker</code> is <code>null</code>. To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the <code>marker</code> request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. </p>
