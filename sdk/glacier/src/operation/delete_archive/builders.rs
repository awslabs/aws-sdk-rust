/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `DeleteArchive`.

/// <p>This operation deletes an archive from a vault. Subsequent requests to initiate a retrieval of this archive will fail. Archive retrievals that are in progress for this archive ID may or may not succeed according to the following scenarios:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>If the archive retrieval job is actively preparing the data for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, the archival retrieval operation might fail.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If the archive retrieval job has successfully prepared the archive for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, you will be able to download the output.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>This operation is idempotent. Attempting to delete an already-deleted archive does not result in an error.</p> 
/// <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default.
