You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '<code>-</code>' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.</p>

This value should be the sum of all the sizes of the individual parts that you uploaded.</p>

It is the tree hash of SHA256 tree hash of the individual parts. If the value you specify in the request does not match the SHA256 tree hash of the final assembled archive as computed by Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier), Glacier returns an error and the request fails.</p>
