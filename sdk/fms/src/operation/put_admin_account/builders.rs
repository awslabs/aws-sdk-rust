/// <p>Creates or updates an Firewall Manager administrator account. The account must be a member of the organization that was onboarded to Firewall Manager by <code>AssociateAdminAccount</code>. Only the organization's management account can create an Firewall Manager administrator account. When you create an Firewall Manager administrator account, the service checks to see if the account is already a delegated administrator within Organizations. If the account isn't a delegated administrator, Firewall Manager calls Organizations to delegate the account within Organizations. For more information about administrator accounts within Organizations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html">Managing the Amazon Web Services Accounts in Your Organization</a>.</p>
