    ///   - [`start_time(DateTime)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetProtectionStatus::start_time) / [`set_start_time(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetProtectionStatus::set_start_time): <p>The start of the time period to query for the attacks. This is a <code>timestamp</code> type. The request syntax listing indicates a <code>number</code> type because the default used by Firewall Manager is Unix time in seconds. However, any valid <code>timestamp</code> format is allowed.</p>

For the second and subsequent <code>GetProtectionStatus</code> requests, specify the value of <code>NextToken</code> from the previous response to get information about another batch of objects.</p>
