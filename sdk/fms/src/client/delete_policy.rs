Protection of out-of-scope resources remains unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and accounts that you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you specify that only resources in specific accounts or with specific tags are in scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are handled by the policy. All others are out of scope. If you don't specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope. </p>
