# aws-sdk-medicalimaging

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This is the _AWS HealthImaging API Reference_. AWS HealthImaging is a HIPAA-eligible service that helps health care providers and their medical imaging ISV partners store, transform, and apply machine learning to medical images. For an introduction to the service, see the [_AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/healthimaging/latest/devguide/what-is.html).

The following sections list AWS HealthImaging API actions categorized according to functionality. Links are provided to actions within this Reference, along with links back to corresponding sections in the _AWS HealthImaging Developer Guide_ where you can view console procedures and CLI/SDK code examples.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-medicalimaging` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.57.1"
aws-sdk-medicalimaging = "0.5.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_medicalimaging as medicalimaging;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), medicalimaging::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_medicalimaging::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-medicalimaging/latest/aws_sdk_medicalimaging/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
