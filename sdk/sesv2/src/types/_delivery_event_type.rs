/// When writing a match expression against `DeliveryEventType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let deliveryeventtype = unimplemented!();
/// match deliveryeventtype {
///     DeliveryEventType::Complaint => { /* ... */ },
///     DeliveryEventType::Delivery => { /* ... */ },
///     DeliveryEventType::PermanentBounce => { /* ... */ },
///     DeliveryEventType::Send => { /* ... */ },
///     DeliveryEventType::TransientBounce => { /* ... */ },
///     DeliveryEventType::UndeterminedBounce => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `deliveryeventtype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DeliveryEventType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DeliveryEventType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DeliveryEventType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `deliveryeventtype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DeliveryEventType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// <p>The type of delivery events:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>SEND</code> - The send request was successful and SES will
/// attempt to deliver the message to the recipient’s mail server. (If account-level
/// or global suppression is being used, SES will still count it as a send,
/// but delivery is suppressed.)</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>DELIVERY</code> - SES successfully delivered the email to the
/// recipient's mail server. Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator and
/// emails addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>TRANSIENT_BOUNCE</code> - Feedback received for
/// delivery failures excluding issues with non-existent mailboxes. Excludes bounces from the
/// mailbox simulator, and those from emails addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>PERMANENT_BOUNCE</code> - Feedback received for
/// emails sent to non-existent mailboxes. Excludes bounces from the mailbox simulator, those
/// originating from your account-level suppression list (if enabled), and those from emails
/// addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>UNDETERMINED_BOUNCE</code> - SES was unable to determine the bounce reason.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>COMPLAINT</code> - Complaint received for the email.
/// This excludes complaints from the mailbox simulator, those originating from
/// your account-level suppression list (if enabled), and those from emails addressed to more
/// than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// </ul>
