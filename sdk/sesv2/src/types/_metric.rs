/// When writing a match expression against `Metric`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let metric = unimplemented!();
/// match metric {
///     Metric::Click => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::Complaint => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::Delivery => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::DeliveryClick => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::DeliveryComplaint => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::DeliveryOpen => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::Open => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::PermanentBounce => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::Send => { /* ... */ },
///     Metric::TransientBounce => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `metric` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `Metric::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `Metric::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `Metric::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `metric` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `Metric::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// <p>The metric to export, can be one of the following:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>SEND</code> - Emails sent eligible for tracking in the VDM
/// dashboard. This excludes emails sent to the mailbox simulator and emails
/// addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>COMPLAINT</code> - Complaints received for your account. This
/// excludes complaints from the mailbox simulator, those originating from your
/// account-level suppression list (if enabled), and those for emails addressed to
/// more than one recipient</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>PERMANENT_BOUNCE</code> - Permanent bounces - i.e., feedback
/// received for emails sent to non-existent mailboxes. Excludes bounces from the
/// mailbox simulator, those originating from your account-level suppression list
/// (if enabled), and those for emails addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>TRANSIENT_BOUNCE</code> - Transient bounces - i.e., feedback
/// received for delivery failures excluding issues with non-existent mailboxes.
/// Excludes bounces from the mailbox simulator, and those for emails addressed to
/// more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>OPEN</code> - Unique open events for emails including open
/// trackers. Excludes opens for emails addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>CLICK</code> - Unique click events for emails including wrapped
/// links. Excludes clicks for emails addressed to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>DELIVERY</code> - Successful deliveries for email sending
/// attempts. Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator and for emails addressed
/// to more than one recipient.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>DELIVERY_OPEN</code> - Successful deliveries for email sending
/// attempts. Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator, for emails addressed to
/// more than one recipient, and emails without open trackers.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>DELIVERY_CLICK</code> - Successful deliveries for email sending
/// attempts. Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator, for emails addressed to
/// more than one recipient, and emails without click trackers.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <code>DELIVERY_COMPLAINT</code> - Successful deliveries for email
/// sending attempts. Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator, for emails
/// addressed to more than one recipient, and emails addressed to recipients hosted
/// by ISPs with which Amazon SES does not have a feedback loop agreement.</p>
