//! <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
//!
//! <p>A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances.
//! This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer
//! also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic
//! only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic
//! by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port
//! number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number
//! for connections from the load balancer to the instances.</p>
//! <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers,
//! and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more
//! information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers.
//! The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers.</p>
//!
//! <p>To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using <a>CreateLoadBalancer</a>.
//! Register your instances with the load balancer using <a>RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer</a>.</p>
//!
//! <p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i>, which means
//! that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK
//! response code.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
