For example, the groups "Research", "Engineering", and "Sales and Marketing" are all tied to the company's documents stored in the data sources Confluence and Salesforce. However, "Sales and Marketing" team only needs access to customer-related documents stored in Salesforce.</p><br>

The highest number ID, which is the ordering ID, is the latest action you want to process and apply on top of other actions with lower number IDs. This prevents previous actions with lower number IDs from possibly overriding the latest action.</p>  <p>The ordering ID can be the Unix time of the last update you made to a group members list. You would then provide this list when calling <code>PutPrincipalMapping</code>. This ensures your <code>PUT</code> action for that updated group with the latest members list doesn't get overwritten by earlier <code>PUT</code> actions for the same group which are yet to be processed.</p>  <p>The default ordering ID is the current Unix time in milliseconds that the action was received by Amazon Kendra.</p><br>
