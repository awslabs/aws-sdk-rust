/// <p>Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the group can no longer access documents only available to that group.</p>
/// <p>For example, after deleting the group "Summer Interns", all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their search results.</p>
/// <p>If you want to delete or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to use the <code>PutPrincipalMapping</code> operation. For example, if a user in the group "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the "Engineering" group when calling <code>PutPrincipalMapping</code>. You can update your internal list of users or sub groups and input this list when calling <code>PutPrincipalMapping</code>.</p>
