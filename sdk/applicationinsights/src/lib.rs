//! <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights</fullname>
//! <p> Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights is a service that
//! helps you detect common problems with your applications. It
//! enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your applications (built with technologies
//! such as Microsoft IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into
//! detected problems.</p>
//! <p>After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights identifies,
//! recommends, and sets up metrics and logs. It continuously analyzes and
//! correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to surface actionable problems with
//! your application. For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to
//! HTTP 500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you
//! that a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server database is occurring. It bases this
//! analysis on impactful metrics and log errors. </p>
