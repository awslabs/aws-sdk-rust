# aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler

This reference provides descriptions of the AWS Application Cost Profiler API.

The AWS Application Cost Profiler API provides programmatic access to view, create, update, and delete application cost report definitions, as well as to import your usage data into the Application Cost Profiler service.

For more information about using this service, see the [AWS Application Cost Profiler User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-cost-profiler/latest/userguide/introduction.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler = "1.21.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_applicationcostprofiler as applicationcostprofiler;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), applicationcostprofiler::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_applicationcostprofiler::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler/latest/aws_sdk_applicationcostprofiler/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
