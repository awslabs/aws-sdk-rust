# aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This reference provides descriptions of the AWS Application Cost Profiler API.

The AWS Application Cost Profiler API provides programmatic access to view, create, update, and delete application cost report definitions, as well as to import your usage data into the Application Cost Profiler service.

For more information about using this service, see the [AWS Application Cost Profiler User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-cost-profiler/latest/userguide/introduction.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.2.0"
aws-sdk-applicationcostprofiler = "0.2.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
