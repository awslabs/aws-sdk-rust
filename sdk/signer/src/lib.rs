//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//!
//! AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and integrity of your code.
//!
//! AWS Signer supports the following applications:
//!
//! With _code signing for AWS Lambda_, you can sign AWS Lambda deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3.
//!
//! With _code signing for IoT_, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for [Amazon FreeRTOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/) and [AWS IoT Device Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/), and is integrated with [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/). In order to sign code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management.
//!
//! For more information about AWS Signer, see the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-signer` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.0.0-smithy-rs-head"
//! aws-sdk-signer = "0.59.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_signer as signer;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), signer::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = signer::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-signer/latest/aws_sdk_signer/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
//!

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
