//! <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and
//! integrity of your code. </p>
//! <p>AWS Signer supports the following applications:</p>
//!
//! <p>With <i>code signing for AWS Lambda</i>, you can sign AWS Lambda
//! deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch,
//! and AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use
//! Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p>
//!
//! <p>With <i>code signing for IoT</i>, you can sign code for any IoT device that is
//! supported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is
//! integrated with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign
//! code, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to
//! sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p>
//! <p>For more information about AWS Signer, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS Signer Developer Guide</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
