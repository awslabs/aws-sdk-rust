description = "<p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code signing service to help you ensure the trust and\n\t\t\tintegrity of your code. </p>\n\t\t       <p>AWS Signer supports the following applications:</p>\n\n\t\t       <p>With <i>code signing for AWS Lambda</i>, you can sign AWS Lambda\n\t\t\tdeployment packages. Integrated support is provided for Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch,\n\t\t\tand AWS CloudTrail. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then use\n\t\t\tSigner to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <p>With <i>code signing for IoT</i>, you can sign code for any IoT device that is\n\t\t\tsupported by AWS. IoT code signing is available for <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/\">Amazon FreeRTOS</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/\">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and is\n\t\t\tintegrated with <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/\">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign\n\t\t\tcode, you import a third-party code signing certificate using ACM, and use that to\n\t\t\tsign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p>\n\t\t       <p>For more information about AWS Signer, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html\">AWS Signer Developer Guide</a>.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <p></p>"
