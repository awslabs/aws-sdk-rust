//! <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find
//! and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
//! see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of
//! all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category
//! keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots.
//! You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it,
//! configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
//! within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
//! AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
//! code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
//! For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
//! GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
//! experiences available:</p><ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including
//! source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. </p>
//! <p>Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other
//! developers, and publish new versions of applications. </p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
