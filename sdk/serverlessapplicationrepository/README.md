# aws-sdk-serverlessapplicationrepository

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications, see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.

The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.

You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs GitHub repository.

The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer experiences available:
  - Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other developers, and publish new versions of applications.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-serverlessapplicationrepository` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.57.1"
aws-sdk-serverlessapplicationrepository = "0.35.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_serverlessapplicationrepository as serverlessapplicationrepository;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), serverlessapplicationrepository::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_serverlessapplicationrepository::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-serverlessapplicationrepository/latest/aws_sdk_serverlessapplicationrepository/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
