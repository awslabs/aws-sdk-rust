It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can provision in the account.</p>  <p>You must specify <code>componentRoleArn</code> to allow directly defined components to be associated with any environments running in this account.</p>  <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
