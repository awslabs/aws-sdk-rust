You create and manage the Proton environment in this account. If the management account accepts the environment account connection, Proton can use the associated IAM role to provision environment infrastructure resources in the associated environment account.</p>

    ///   - [`tags(Vec<Tag>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<Vec<Tag>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection::set_tags): <p>An optional list of metadata items that you can associate with the Proton environment account connection. A tag is a key-value pair.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/resources.html">Proton resources and tagging</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>

It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can provision in the account.</p>  <p>You must specify <code>componentRoleArn</code> to allow directly defined components to be associated with any environments running in this account.</p>  <p>For more information about components, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html">Proton components</a> in the <i>Proton User Guide</i>.</p>
