Kinesis Data Firehose might be unable to retire the grant due to a customer error, such as when the CMK or the grant are in an invalid state. If you force deletion, you can then use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeGrant.html">RevokeGrant</a> operation to revoke the grant you gave to Kinesis Data Firehose. If a failure to retire the grant happens due to an Amazon Web Services KMS issue, Kinesis Data Firehose keeps retrying the delete operation.</p>  <p>The default value is false.</p>
