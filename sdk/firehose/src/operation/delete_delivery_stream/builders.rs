/// <p>Deletes a delivery stream and its data.</p>
/// <p>To check the state of a delivery stream, use <code>DescribeDeliveryStream</code>. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>DELETING</code>, <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, or <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the <code>CREATING</code> state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state.</p>
/// <p>While the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.</p>
