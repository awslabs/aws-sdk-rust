/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutRecord`.
///
/// <p>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. To write multiple data records into a delivery stream, use <code>PutRecordBatch</code>. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers.</p>
/// <p>By default, each delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB per second. If you use <code>PutRecord</code> and <code>PutRecordBatch</code>, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each delivery stream. For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits</a>. </p>
/// <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <code>PutRecord</code>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KiB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it can be a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p>
/// <p>Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (<code>\n</code>) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination.</p>
/// <p>The <code>PutRecord</code> operation returns a <code>RecordId</code>, which is a unique string assigned to each record. Producer applications can use this ID for purposes such as auditability and investigation.</p>
/// <p>If the <code>PutRecord</code> operation throws a <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>, back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream. </p>
/// <p>Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are added to a delivery stream as it tries to send the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer available.</p> <important>
/// <p>Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records. Instead, concatenate the raw data, then perform base64 encoding.</p>
/// </important>
