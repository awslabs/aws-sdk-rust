# aws-sdk-ec2instanceconnect

This is the _ Amazon EC2 Instance Connect API Reference_. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions for Amazon EC2 Instance Connect. Amazon EC2 Instance Connect enables system administrators to publish one-time use SSH public keys to EC2, providing users a simple and secure way to connect to their instances.

To view the Amazon EC2 Instance Connect content in the _ Amazon EC2 User Guide_, see [Connect to your Linux instance using EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Connect-using-EC2-Instance-Connect.html).

For Amazon EC2 APIs, see the [Amazon EC2 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ec2instanceconnect` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-ec2instanceconnect = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_ec2instanceconnect as ec2instanceconnect;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), ec2instanceconnect::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_ec2instanceconnect::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-ec2instanceconnect/latest/aws_sdk_ec2instanceconnect/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
