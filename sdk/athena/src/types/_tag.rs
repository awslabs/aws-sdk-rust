/// <p>A label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data catalogs in your account. For best practices, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/">Tagging Best Practices</a>. Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by commas. </p>
