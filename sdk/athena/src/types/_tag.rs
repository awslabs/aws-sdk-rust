/// <p>A label that you assign to a resource. Athena resources include workgroups, data catalogs, and capacity reservations. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena resources by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter the resources in your account. For best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html">Tagging Best Practices</a>. Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.</p>
