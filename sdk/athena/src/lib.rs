//! <p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL
//! to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your
//! data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay
//! only for the queries you run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries
//! in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more
//! information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">What is Amazon Athena</a> in the <i>Amazon Athena User
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the
//! driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not
//! support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html">Accessing
//! Amazon Athena with JDBC</a>.</p>
//! <p>For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html">Examples and
//! Code Samples</a> in the <i>Amazon Athena User
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
