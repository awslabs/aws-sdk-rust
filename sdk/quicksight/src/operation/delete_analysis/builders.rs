/// <p>Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.</p>
/// <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code> API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p>
/// <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.</p>
