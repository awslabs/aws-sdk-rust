The session lifetime must be in [15-600] minutes range.</p>

Before you use this parameter, make sure that you have configured the relevant datasets using the <code>DataSet$RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration</code> parameter so that session tags can be used to provide row-level security.</p>  <p>These are not the tags used for the Amazon Web Services resource tagging feature. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-dev-rls-tags.html">Using Row-Level Security (RLS) with Tags</a>in the <i>Amazon QuickSight User Guide</i>.</p>

If you choose <code>Dashboard</code> embedding experience, pass the list of dashboard ARNs in the account that you want the user to be able to view. Currently, you can pass up to 25 dashboard ARNs in each API call.</p>

This optional parameter overrides the static domains that are configured in the Manage QuickSight menu in the Amazon QuickSight console. Instead, it allows only the domains that you include in this parameter. You can list up to three domains or subdomains in each API call.</p>  <p>To include all subdomains under a specific domain to the allow list, use <code>*</code>. For example, <code>https://*.sapp.amazon.com</code> includes all subdomains under <code>https://sapp.amazon.com</code>.</p>
