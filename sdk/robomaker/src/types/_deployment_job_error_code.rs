/// When writing a match expression against `DeploymentJobErrorCode`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let deploymentjoberrorcode = unimplemented!();
/// match deploymentjoberrorcode {
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::BadLambdaAssociated => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::BadPermissionError => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::DeploymentFleetDoesNotExist => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::DownloadConditionFailed => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::EnvironmentSetupError => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::EtagMismatch => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::ExtractingBundleFailure => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::FailureThresholdBreached => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::FleetDeploymentTimeout => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::GreengrassDeploymentFailed => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::GreengrassGroupVersionDoesNotExist => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::InternalServerError => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::InvalidGreengrassGroup => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::LambdaDeleted => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::MissingRobotApplicationArchitecture => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::MissingRobotArchitecture => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::MissingRobotDeploymentResource => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::PostLaunchFileFailure => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::PreLaunchFileFailure => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::ResourceNotFound => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::RobotAgentConnectionTimeout => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::RobotApplicationDoesNotExist => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::RobotDeploymentAborted => { /* ... */ },
///     DeploymentJobErrorCode::RobotDeploymentNoResponse => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `deploymentjoberrorcode` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DeploymentJobErrorCode::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DeploymentJobErrorCode::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DeploymentJobErrorCode::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `deploymentjoberrorcode` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DeploymentJobErrorCode::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
