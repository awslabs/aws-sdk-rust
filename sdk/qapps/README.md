# aws-sdk-qapps

The Amazon Q Apps feature capability within Amazon Q Business allows web experience users to create lightweight, purpose-built AI apps to fulfill specific tasks from within their web experience. For example, users can create a Q App that exclusively generates marketing-related content to improve your marketing team's productivity or a Q App for writing customer emails and creating promotional content using a certain style of voice, tone, and branding. For more information on the capabilities, see [Amazon Q Apps capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/deploy-experience-iam-role.html#q-apps-actions) in the _Amazon Q Business User Guide_.

For an overview of the Amazon Q App APIs, see [Overview of Amazon Q Apps API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_Operations_QApps.html).

For information about the IAM access control permissions you need to use the Amazon Q Apps API, see [IAM role for the Amazon Q Business web experience including Amazon Q Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/deploy-experience-iam-role.html) in the _Amazon Q Business User Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-qapps` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-qapps = "1.9.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_qapps as qapps;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), qapps::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_qapps::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-qapps/latest/aws_sdk_qapps/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
