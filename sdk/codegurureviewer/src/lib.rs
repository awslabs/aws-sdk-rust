//! <p>This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a
//! service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that
//! are difficult for developers to find and recommends fixes in your Java and Python
//! code.</p>
//! 
//! <p>By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and
//! implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the overall quality and maintainability of
//! your code base during the code review stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the
//! <i>
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html">Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</a>.</i>
//! </p>
//! 
//! <p>To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection
//! between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an <i>interface VPC endpoint</i>. For
//! more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/vpc-interface-endpoints.html">CodeGuru Reviewer and interface VPC
//! endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)</a> in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
