//! <p>This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service
//! that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for developers to find and recommends
//! fixes in your Java and Python code.</p>
//!
//! <p>By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer
//! improves the overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the
//! <i>
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html">Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</a>.</i>
//! </p>
//!
//! <p>
//! To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by
//! creating an <i>interface VPC endpoint</i>. For more information, see
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/vpc-interface-endpoints.html">CodeGuru Reviewer and interface
//! VPC endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)</a> in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</i>.
//! </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
