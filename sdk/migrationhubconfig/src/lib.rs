//! <p>The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working with your
//! Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to determine a home region, as well as to
//! create and work with controls that describe the home region.</p>
//! 
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate,
//! import, or put) while in your home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code>
//! error is returned.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of
//! your home region.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>If you call a write API outside the home region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code>
//! is returned.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>You can call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> action to obtain the account's Migration Hub
//! home region.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! 
//! <p>For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub Home Region
//! API reference. </p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
