You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, <code>Z</code>. For example, <code>"2016-09-27T14:50Z"</code>. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.</p>
    ///   - [`max_items(i64)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetSampledRequests::max_items) / [`set_max_items(i64)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetSampledRequests::set_max_items): <p>The number of requests that you want AWS WAF to return from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than the value of <code>MaxItems</code>, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns information about all of them. </p>

    ///   - [`time_window(Option<TimeWindow>)`](crate::output::GetSampledRequestsOutput::time_window): <p>Usually, <code>TimeWindow</code> is the time range that you specified in the <code>GetSampledRequests</code> request.
