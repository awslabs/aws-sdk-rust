/// <p>In a <code>GetSampledRequests</code> response, the <code>StartTime</code> and <code>EndTime</code> objects specify the time range for which AWS WAF actually returned a sample of web requests. AWS WAF gets the specified number of requests from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource receives during the specified time period. If your resource receives more than 5,000 requests during that period, AWS WAF stops sampling after the 5,000th request. In that case, <code>EndTime</code> is the time that AWS WAF received the 5,000th request. </p>
