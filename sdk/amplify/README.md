# aws-sdk-amplify

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amplify enables developers to develop and deploy cloud-powered mobile and web apps. The Amplify Console provides a continuous delivery and hosting service for web applications. For more information, see the [Amplify Console User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html). The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation for client app development. For more information, see the [Amplify Framework.](https://docs.amplify.aws/)

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-amplify` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.25-alpha"
aws-sdk-amplify = "0.0.25-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
