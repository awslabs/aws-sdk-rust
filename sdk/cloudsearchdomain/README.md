# aws-sdk-cloudsearchdomain

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search domain and search those documents.

The endpoints for submitting UploadDocuments, Search, and Suggest requests are domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service DescribeDomains action. The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search endpoint.

For more information, see the [Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide).

## Getting Started

> Examples are availble for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-cloudsearchdomain` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.21-alpha"
aws-sdk-cloudsearchdomain = "0.0.21-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
