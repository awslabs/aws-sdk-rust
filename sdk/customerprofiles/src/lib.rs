//! <fullname>Amazon Connect Customer Profiles</fullname>
//! <p>Welcome to the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference. This guide provides information
//! about the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API, including supported operations, data types,
//! parameters, and schemas.</p>
//! <p>Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is a unified customer profile for your contact center that has
//! pre-built connectors powered by AppFlow that make it easy to combine customer information
//! from third party applications, such as Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (ITSM), and your
//! enterprise resource planning (ERP), with contact history from your Amazon Connect contact
//! center.</p>
//! <p>If you're new to Amazon Connect , you might find it helpful to also review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/what-is-amazon-connect.html">Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
