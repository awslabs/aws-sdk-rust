//! <fullname>Amazon Connect Customer Profiles</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is a unified customer profile for your contact center that has
//! pre-built connectors powered by AppFlow that make it easy to combine customer information
//! from third party applications, such as Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (ITSM), and your
//! enterprise resource planning (ERP), with contact history from your Amazon Connect contact center.
//! If you're new to Amazon Connect, you might find it helpful to review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/">Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</a>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
