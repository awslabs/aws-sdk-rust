/// <p>Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone. </p> <important> 
/// <p>To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.</p> 
/// </important> <note> 
/// <p>If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different account, the Amazon Web Services account that created the private hosted zone must first submit a <code>CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request. Then the account that created the VPC must submit an <code>AssociateVPCWithHostedZone</code> request.</p> 
/// </note> <note> 
/// <p>When granting access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.</p> 
/// <p>The following are the supported partitions:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> <code>aws</code> - Amazon Web Services Regions</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>aws-cn</code> - China Regions</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>aws-us-gov</code> - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region</p> </li>
