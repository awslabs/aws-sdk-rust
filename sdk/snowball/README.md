# aws-sdk-snowball

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The Amazon Web Services Snow Family provides a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow Family commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the Amazon Web Services Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow Family device. To transfer data locally with a Snow Family device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-snowball` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.57.1"
aws-sdk-snowball = "0.35.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_snowball as snowball;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), snowball::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_snowball::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-snowball/latest/aws_sdk_snowball/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
