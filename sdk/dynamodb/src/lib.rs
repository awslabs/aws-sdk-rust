//! <fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname>
//!
//! <p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast
//! and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you
//! offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so
//! that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration,
//! replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.</p>
//!
//! <p>With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve
//! any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale
//! down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and
//! use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance
//! metrics.</p>
//!
//! <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over
//! a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while
//! maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state
//! disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an
//! Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data
//! durability.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/dynamodb).
