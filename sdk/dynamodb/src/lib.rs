//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//! 
//! Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
//! 
//! With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.
//! 
//! DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.
//! 
//! ## Getting Started
//! 
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//! 
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-dynamodb` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//! 
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.0.0-smithy-rs-head"
//! aws-sdk-dynamodb = "0.25.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//! 
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//! 
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_dynamodb as dynamodb;
//! 
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), dynamodb::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = dynamodb::Client::new(&config);
//! 
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//! 
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-dynamodb/latest/aws_sdk_dynamodb/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//! 
//! ## Using the SDK
//! 
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//! 
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/dynamodb).
