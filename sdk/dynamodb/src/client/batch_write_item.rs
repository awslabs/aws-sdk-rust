Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must provide <i>all</i> of the key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for <i>both</i> the partition key and the sort key.</p> </li>    </ul> </li>   <li> <p> <code>PutRequest</code> - Perform a <code>PutItem</code> operation on the specified item. The item to be put is identified by an <code>Item</code> subelement:</p>    <ul>     <li> <p> <code>Item</code> - A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attribute values must not be null; string and binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty. Requests that contain empty values are rejected with a <code>ValidationException</code> exception.</p> <p>If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition.</p> </li>    </ul> </li>  </ul>
