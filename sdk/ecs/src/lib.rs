//! <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service. It makes
//! it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a
//! serverless infrastructure that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on
//! Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
//! or External (on-premises) instances that you manage.</p>
//! <p>Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API
//! calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,
//! and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p>
//! <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on
//! your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you
//! don't need to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems.
//! You also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/ecs).
