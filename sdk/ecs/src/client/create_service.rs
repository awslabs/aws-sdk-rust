    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateService`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.</p>
    ///   - [`service_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::service_name) / [`set_service_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_service_name): <p>The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.</p>
    ///   - [`task_definition(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::task_definition) / [`set_task_definition(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_task_definition): <p>The <code>family</code> and <code>revision</code> (<code>family:revision</code>) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a <code>revision</code> isn't specified, the latest <code>ACTIVE</code> revision is used.</p>  <p>A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the <code>ECS</code> or <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controllers.</p>
    ///   - [`load_balancers(Vec<LoadBalancer>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::load_balancers) / [`set_load_balancers(Option<Vec<LoadBalancer>>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_load_balancers): <p>A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service load balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>  <p>If the service uses the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target groups. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>  <p>If the service uses the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a <code>targetGroupPair</code>). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status <code>PRIMARY</code>, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.</p>  <p>If you use the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service.</p>  <p>For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container definition. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group that's specified here.</p>  <p>For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name , and the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container definition. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer that's specified here.</p>  <p>Services with tasks that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose <code>ip</code> as the target type, not <code>instance</code>. This is because tasks that use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>

It must be unique and is case sensitive. Up to 32 ASCII characters are allowed.</p>
    ///   - [`launch_type(LaunchType)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::launch_type) / [`set_launch_type(Option<LaunchType>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_launch_type): <p>The infrastructure that you run your service on. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon ECS launch types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>  <p>The <code>FARGATE</code> launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand infrastructure.</p> <note>   <p>Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider strategy must be used.

This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition doesn't use the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode. If you specify the <code>role</code> parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the <code>loadBalancers</code> parameter.</p> <important>   <p>If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't specify a role here. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>  </important>  <p>If your specified role has a path other than <code>/</code>, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name <code>bar</code> has a path of <code>/foo/</code> then you would specify <code>/foo/bar</code> as the role name.

You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at runtime.</p>
    ///   - [`placement_strategy(Vec<PlacementStrategy>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::placement_strategy) / [`set_placement_strategy(Option<Vec<PlacementStrategy>>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_placement_strategy): <p>The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.</p>
    ///   - [`network_configuration(NetworkConfiguration)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::network_configuration) / [`set_network_configuration(Option<NetworkConfiguration>)`](crate::operation::create_service::builders::CreateServiceFluentBuilder::set_network_configuration): <p>The network configuration for the service.

This is only used when your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify a health check grace period value, the default value of <code>0</code> is used.</p>  <p>If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the <code>startPeriod</code> in the task definition health check parameters. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html">Health check</a>.</p>  <p>If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.</p>

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Services</a>.</p>  <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>REPLICA</code>-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code>-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.</p> <note>     <p>Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types don't support the <code>DAEMON</code> scheduling strategy.</p>    </note> </li>  </ul>
