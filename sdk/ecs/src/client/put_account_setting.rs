The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>taskLongArnFormat</code> - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>containerInstanceLongArnFormat</code> - When modified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>awsvpcTrunking</code> - When modified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If <code>awsvpcTrunking</code> is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html">Elastic Network Interface Trunking</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>containerInsights</code> - When modified, the default setting indicating whether Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Container Insights is turned on for your clusters is changed. If <code>containerInsights</code> is turned on, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights turned on unless you disable it during cluster creation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html">CloudWatch Container Insights</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>dualStackIPv6</code> - When turned on, when using a VPC in dual stack mode, your tasks using the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode can have an IPv6 address assigned. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Amazon EC2 instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html#task-networking-vpc-dual-stack">Using a VPC in dual-stack mode</a>. For more information on using IPv6 with tasks launched on Fargate, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-task-networking.html#fargate-task-networking-vpc-dual-stack">Using a VPC in dual-stack mode</a>.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod</code> - When Amazon Web Services determines that a security or infrastructure update is needed for an Amazon ECS task hosted on Fargate, the tasks need to be stopped and new tasks launched to replace them. Use <code>fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod</code> to configure the wait time to retire a Fargate task. For information about the Fargate tasks maintenance, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html">Amazon Web Services Fargate task maintenance</a> in the <i>Amazon ECS Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>tagResourceAuthorization</code> - Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as <code>ecsCreateCluster</code>. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the <code>ecs:TagResource</code> action. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html">Grant permission to tag resources on creation</a> in the <i>Amazon ECS Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>  <li>   <p><code>guardDutyActivate</code> - The <code>guardDutyActivate</code> parameter is read-only in Amazon ECS and indicates whether Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring is enabled or disabled by your security administrator in your Amazon ECS account. Amazon GuardDuty controls this account setting on your behalf. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-guard-duty-integration.html">Protecting Amazon ECS workloads with Amazon ECS Runtime Monitoring</a>.</p></li> </ul><br>
