Up to <code>100</code> capacity providers can be described in an action.</p>
    ///   - [`include(Vec<CapacityProviderField>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCapacityProviders::include) / [`set_include(Option<Vec<CapacityProviderField>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCapacityProviders::set_include): <p>Specifies whether or not you want to see the resource tags for the capacity provider. If <code>TAGS</code> is specified, the tags are included in the response. If this field is omitted, tags aren't included in the response.</p>

When this parameter is used, <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> only returns <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code> response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> request with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and 10. If this parameter is not used, then <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> returns up to 10 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCapacityProviders::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCapacityProviders::set_next_token): <p>The <code>nextToken</code> value returned from a previous paginated <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> request where <code>maxResults</code> was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the <code>nextToken</code> value.</p> <note>   <p>This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.</p>  </note>

    ///   - [`failures(Option<Vec<Failure>>)`](crate::output::DescribeCapacityProvidersOutput::failures): <p>Any failures associated with the call.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeCapacityProvidersOutput::next_token): <p>The <code>nextToken</code> value to include in a future <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> request. When the results of a <code>DescribeCapacityProviders</code> request exceed <code>maxResults</code>, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is <code>null</code> when there are no more results to return.</p>
