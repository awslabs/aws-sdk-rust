Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Do not use <code>aws:</code>, <code>AWS:</code>, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.</p> </li>  </ul>
