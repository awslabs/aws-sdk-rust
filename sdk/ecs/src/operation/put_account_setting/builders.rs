/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutAccountSetting`.
///
/// <p>Modifies an account setting. Account settings are set on a per-Region basis.</p>
/// <p>If you change the account setting for the root user, the default settings for all of the users and roles that no individual account setting was specified are reset for. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html">Account Settings</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>When <code>serviceLongArnFormat</code>, <code>taskLongArnFormat</code>, or <code>containerInstanceLongArnFormat</code> are specified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.</p>
/// <p>When <code>awsvpcTrunking</code> is specified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If <code>awsvpcTrunking</code> is enabled, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html">Elastic Network Interface Trunking</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>When <code>containerInsights</code> is specified, the default setting indicating whether CloudWatch Container Insights is enabled for your clusters is changed. If <code>containerInsights</code> is enabled, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights enabled unless you disable it during cluster creation.
