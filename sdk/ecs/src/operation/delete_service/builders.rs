/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `DeleteService`.

/// <p>Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you can't delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see <code>UpdateService</code>.</p> <note> 
/// <p>When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from <code>ACTIVE</code> to <code>DRAINING</code>, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the <code>ListServices</code> API operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either <code>STOPPING</code> or <code>STOPPED</code> status, the service status moves from <code>DRAINING</code> to <code>INACTIVE</code>. Services in the <code>DRAINING</code> or <code>INACTIVE</code> status can still be viewed with the <code>DescribeServices</code> API operation. However, in the future, <code>INACTIVE</code> services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and <code>DescribeServices</code> calls on those services return a <code>ServiceNotFoundException</code> error.</p> 
/// </note> <important> 
/// <p>If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>DRAINING</code> status, you receive an error.</p>
