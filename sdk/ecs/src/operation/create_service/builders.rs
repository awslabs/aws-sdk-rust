/// <p>On March 21, 2024, a change was made to resolve the task definition revision before authorization. When a task definition revision is not specified, authorization will occur using the latest revision of a task definition.</p>
/// </note> <note>
/// <p>Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is no longer available to customers.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.

/// <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service scheduler concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Amazon ECS services</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>The deployment controller is the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for your service. The valid options are:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>ECS</p>
/// <p>When you create a service which uses the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, you can choose between the following deployment strategies (which you can set in the “<code>strategy</code>” field in “<code>deploymentConfiguration</code>”): :</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>ROLLING</code>: When you create a service which uses the <i>rolling update</i> (<code>ROLLING</code>) deployment strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment configuration. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html">Deploy Amazon ECS services by replacing tasks</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>Gradual service updates: You need to update your service incrementally without taking the entire service offline at once.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the additional resource costs of running two complete environments simultaneously (as required by blue/green deployments).</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a longer deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one by one.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process that takes minutes rather than seconds.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple environments, target groups, and listeners.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect (which are required for blue/green deployments).</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that makes it difficult to run two parallel environments.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not running duplicate environments during deployment.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for many common application scenarios.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>BLUE_GREEN</code>: A <i>blue/green</i> deployment strategy (<code>BLUE_GREEN</code>) is a release methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the ability to quickly roll back if needed.

/// <p>When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level.

During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status <code>PRIMARY</code>, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the replacement task set.
