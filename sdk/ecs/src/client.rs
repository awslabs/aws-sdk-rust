For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service scheduler concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li>
    /// <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service scheduler concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li>

For example, the deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired count of a service. This is done with an <code>UpdateService</code> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p>
    /// <p>If a service uses the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy . If they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p>
    /// <p>If a service uses the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p>
    /// <p>If a service uses either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. This is while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used.
