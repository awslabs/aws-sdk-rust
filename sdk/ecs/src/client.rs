This is only used when your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify a health check grace period value, the default value of <code>0</code> is used.</p>  <p>If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the <code>startPeriod</code> in the task definition health check parameters.

During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.</p>

By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code>-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.</p> <note>     <p>Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types don't support the <code>DAEMON</code> scheduling strategy.</p>    </note> </li>  </ul>

The <code>PutClusterCapacityProviders</code> API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> status can be used.</p>  <p>If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the <code>CreateCapacityProvider</code> API operation.</p>  <p>To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the <code>FARGATE</code> or <code>FARGATE_SPOT</code> capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.</p>  <p>The <code>PutClusterCapacityProviders</code> API operation is used to update the list of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is created.</p>  <p></p>
