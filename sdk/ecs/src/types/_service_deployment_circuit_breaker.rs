/// <p>Information about the circuit breaker used to determine when a service deployment has failed.</p>
/// <p>The deployment circuit breaker is the rolling update mechanism that determines if the tasks reach a steady state. The deployment circuit breaker has an option that will automatically roll back a failed deployment to the last cpompleted service revision. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-circuit-breaker.html">How the Amazon ECS deployment circuit breaker detects failures</a> in the<i> Amazon ECS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
