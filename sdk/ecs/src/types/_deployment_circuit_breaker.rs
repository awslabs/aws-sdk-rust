/// <p>The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment type that aren't behind a Classic Load Balancer.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>The <b>deployment circuit breaker</b> determines whether a service deployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If enabled, a service deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launching new tasks. You can also configure Amazon ECS to roll back your service to the last completed deployment after a failure. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html">Rolling update</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
