/// <p>The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the <code>RunTask</code> or <code>CreateCluster</code> APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the <code>CreateCluster</code> API.</p> 
/// <p>Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The <code>PutClusterCapacityProviders</code> API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.</p> 
/// <p>If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the <code>CreateCapacityProvider</code> API operation.</p> 
/// <p>To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the <code>FARGATE</code> or <code>FARGATE_SPOT</code> capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy.</p>
