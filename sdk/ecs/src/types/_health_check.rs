/// <p>An object representing a container health check. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image or from the image's Dockerfile).</p> <note> 
/// <p>The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.</p> 
/// <p>The following describes the possible <code>healthStatus</code> values for a container:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> <code>HEALTHY</code>-The container health check has passed successfully.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>UNHEALTHY</code>-The container health check has failed.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>UNKNOWN</code>-The container health check is being evaluated or there's no container health check defined.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>The following describes the possible <code>healthStatus</code> values for a task. The container health check status of nonessential containers only affects the health status of a task if no essential containers have health checks defined.</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> <code>HEALTHY</code>-All essential containers within the task have passed their health checks.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>UNHEALTHY</code>-One or more essential containers have failed their health check.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <code>UNKNOWN</code>-The essential containers within the task are still having their health checks evaluated or there are only nonessential containers with health checks defined.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.</p> <important> 
/// <p>For tasks that are a part of a service and the service uses the <code>ECS</code> rolling deployment type, the deployment is paused while the new tasks have the <code>UNKNOWN</code> task health check status. For example, tasks that define health checks for nonessential containers when no essential containers have health checks will have the <code>UNKNOWN</code> health check status indefinitely which prevents the deployment from completing.</p> 
/// </important> 
/// <p>The following are notes about container health check support:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html">Updating the Amazon ECS container agent</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using platform version <code>1.1.0</code> or greater. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html">Fargate platform versions</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of a service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.</p> </li> 
/// </ul>
