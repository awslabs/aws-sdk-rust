description = "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>\n\t\t       <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes\n\t\t\tit easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your\n\t\t\tcluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your\n\t\t\tservices or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster\n\t\t\tof Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.</p>\n\t\t       <p>Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API\n\t\t\tcalls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives\n\t\t\tyou access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p>\n\t\t       <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on\n\t\t\tyour resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates\n\t\t\tthe need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management\n\t\t\tsystems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>"
