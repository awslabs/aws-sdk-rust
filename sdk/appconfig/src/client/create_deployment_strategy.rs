If an alarm is triggered during this time, AppConfig rolls back the deployment. You must configure permissions for AppConfig to roll back based on CloudWatch alarms. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-appconfig-cloudwatch-alarms-permissions.html">Configuring permissions for rollback based on Amazon CloudWatch alarms</a> in the <i>AppConfig User Guide</i>.</p>

AppConfig supports the following growth types:</p>  <p> <b>Linear</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for <code>Step percentage</code>. For example, a linear deployment that uses a <code>Step percentage</code> of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets have successfully received the configuration.</p>  <p> <b>Exponential</b>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: <code>G*(2^N)</code>. In this formula, <code>G</code> is the growth factor specified by the user and <code>N</code> is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:</p>  <p> <code>2*(2^0)</code> </p>  <p> <code>2*(2^1)</code> </p>  <p> <code>2*(2^2)</code> </p>  <p>Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.</p>
