//! <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy
//! application configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of
//! any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
//! applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT
//! devices.</p>
//! <p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production
//! systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes
//! validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the
//! configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application
//! configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against
//! the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the
//! configuration data is valid.</p>
//! <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the
//! deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the
//! change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment
//! strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including
//! velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment
//! triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p>
//! <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new
//! features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.
//! </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully
//! introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production
//! traffic.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium
//! subscribers to access paid content. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce
//! stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
//! system.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
