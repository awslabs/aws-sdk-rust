# aws-sdk-costandusagereport

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The AWS Cost and Usage Report API enables you to programmatically create, query, and delete AWS Cost and Usage report definitions.

AWS Cost and Usage reports track the monthly AWS costs and usage associated with your AWS account. The report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS product, usage type, and operation that your AWS account uses. You can configure the AWS Cost and Usage report to show only the data that you want, using the AWS Cost and Usage API.

Service Endpoint

The AWS Cost and Usage Report API provides the following endpoint:
  - cur.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-costandusagereport` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.14.0"
aws-sdk-costandusagereport = "0.14.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
