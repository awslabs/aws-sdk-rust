//! <fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build
//! distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push
//! real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery
//! protocols. For more information about this product see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon SNS product page</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features
//! and their associated API calls, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p>
//! <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html">Identity and access management in Amazon SNS</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer
//! Guide.</i>
//! </p>
//! <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming
//! language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as:
//! cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error
//! responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/sns).
