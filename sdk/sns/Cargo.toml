Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push\n            real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery\n            protocols. For more information about this product see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Amazon SNS product page</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features\n            and their associated API calls, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/\">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p>\n        <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html\">Identity and access management in Amazon SNS</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer\n                Guide.</i>\n         </p>\n        <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming\n            language.
