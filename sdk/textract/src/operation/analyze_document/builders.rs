/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `AnalyzeDocument`.
///
/// <p>Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items. </p>
/// <p>The types of information returned are as follows: </p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two <code>Block</code> objects, each of type <code>KEY_VALUE_SET</code>: a KEY <code>Block</code> object and a VALUE <code>Block</code> object. For example, <i>Name: Ana Silva Carolina</i> contains a key and value. <i>Name:</i> is the key. <i>Ana Silva Carolina</i> is the value.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Table and table cell data. A TABLE <code>Block</code> object contains information about a detected table. A CELL <code>Block</code> object is returned for each cell in a table.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Lines and words of text. A LINE <code>Block</code> object contains one or more WORD <code>Block</code> objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of <code>FeatureTypes</code>). </p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Signatures. A SIGNATURE <code>Block</code> object contains the location information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.</p> </li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT <code>Block</code> object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.</p>
/// <p>You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the <code>FeatureTypes</code> list. </p>
/// <p>The output is returned in a list of <code>Block</code> objects.</p>
/// <p> <code>AnalyzeDocument</code> is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use <code>StartDocumentAnalysis</code>.</p>
/// <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-analyzing.html">Document Text Analysis</a>.</p>
