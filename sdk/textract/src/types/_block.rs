/// <p>A <code>Block</code> represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a <code>Block</code> object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example <code>DetectDocumentText</code>), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example <code>AnalyzeDocument</code>), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.</p> 
/// <p>An array of <code>Block</code> objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as <code>DetectDocumentText</code>, the array of <code>Block</code> objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as <code>GetDocumentAnalysis</code>, the array is returned over one or more responses.</p>
