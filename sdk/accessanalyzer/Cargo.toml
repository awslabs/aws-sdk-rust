description = "<p>AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by enabling you to identify\n         any policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based\n         reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your AWS environment. An external\n         principal can be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated\n         user, an AWS service, or an anonymous user. You can also use Access Analyzer to preview and\n         validate public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions\n         changes. This guide describes the AWS IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call\n         programmatically. For general information about Access Analyzer, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html\">AWS IAM Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User Guide</b>.</p>\n         <p>To start using Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.</p>"
