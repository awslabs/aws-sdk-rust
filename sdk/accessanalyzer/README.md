# aws-sdk-accessanalyzer

Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps you to set, verify, and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities. Its features include findings for external and unused access, basic and custom policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to generate fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to identify external or unused access, you first need to create an analyzer.

__External access analyzers__ help identify potential risks of accessing resources by enabling you to identify any resource policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes.

__Unused access analyzers__ help identify potential identity access risks by enabling you to identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level permissions.

Beyond findings, IAM Access Analyzer provides basic and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies before deploying permissions changes. You can use policy generation to refine permissions by attaching a policy generated using access activity logged in CloudTrail logs.

This guide describes the IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access Analyzer, see [Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) in the __IAM User Guide__.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-accessanalyzer` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-accessanalyzer = "1.23.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_accessanalyzer as accessanalyzer;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), accessanalyzer::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_accessanalyzer::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-accessanalyzer/latest/aws_sdk_accessanalyzer/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
