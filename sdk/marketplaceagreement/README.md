# aws-sdk-marketplaceagreement

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses. The AWS Marketplace Agreement Service provides an API interface that helps AWS Marketplace sellers manage their product-related agreements, including listing, searching, and filtering agreements.

To manage agreements in AWS Marketplace, you must ensure that your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and roles are set up. The user must have the required policies/permissions that allow them to carry out the actions in AWS:
  - DescribeAgreement – Grants permission to users to obtain detailed meta data about any of their agreements.
  - GetAgreementTerms – Grants permission to users to obtain details about the terms of an agreement.
  - SearchAgreements – Grants permission to users to search through all their agreements.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-marketplaceagreement` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-marketplaceagreement = "1.18.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_marketplaceagreement as marketplaceagreement;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), marketplaceagreement::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_marketplaceagreement::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-marketplaceagreement/latest/aws_sdk_marketplaceagreement/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
