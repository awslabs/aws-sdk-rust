description = "<p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes\n      the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses\n      threat intelligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and machine learning to\n      identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS\n      environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed\n      credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty can\n      detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware or mine bitcoin. </p>\n         <p>GuardDuty also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise. Some examples\n      of this are unauthorized infrastructure deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a Region\n      that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce\n      password strength. </p>\n         <p>GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS environment by producing security findings\n      that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more\n      information, see the <i>\n               <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html\">Amazon\n          GuardDuty User Guide</a>\n            </i>. </p>"
