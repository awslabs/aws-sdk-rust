/// <p>Invites Amazon Web Services accounts to become members of an organization administered by the Amazon Web Services account that invokes this API. If you are using Amazon Web Services Organizations to manage your GuardDuty environment, this step is not needed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html">Managing accounts with organizations</a>.</p>
/// <p>To invite Amazon Web Services accounts, the first step is to ensure that GuardDuty has been enabled in the potential member accounts. You can now invoke this API to add accounts by invitation. The invited accounts can either accept or decline the invitation from their GuardDuty accounts. Each invited Amazon Web Services account can choose to accept the invitation from only one Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_invitations.html">Managing GuardDuty accounts by invitation</a>.</p>
/// <p>After the invite has been accepted and you choose to disassociate a member account (by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DisassociateMembers.html">DisassociateMembers</a>) from your account, the details of the member account obtained by invoking <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html">CreateMembers</a>, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that you can invoke InviteMembers without the need to invoke <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html">CreateMembers</a> again. To remove the details associated with a member account, you must also invoke <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html">DeleteMembers</a>.</p>
