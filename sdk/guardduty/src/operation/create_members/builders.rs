/// <p>Creates member accounts of the current Amazon Web Services account by specifying a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs. This step is a prerequisite for managing the associated member accounts either by invitation or through an organization.</p>
/// <p>As a delegated administrator, using <code>CreateMembers</code> will enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with the exception of the organization delegated administrator account. A delegated administrator must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.</p>
/// <p>When you use CreateMembers as an Organizations delegated administrator, GuardDuty applies your organization's auto-enable settings to the member accounts in this request, irrespective of the accounts being new or existing members. For more information about the existing auto-enable settings for your organization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConfiguration.html">DescribeOrganizationConfiguration</a>.</p>
/// <p>If you are adding accounts by invitation, before using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html">InviteMembers</a>, use <code>CreateMembers</code> after GuardDuty has been enabled in potential member accounts.</p>
/// <p>If you disassociate a member from a GuardDuty delegated administrator, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html">InviteMembers</a> API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html">DeleteMembers</a> API.</p>
