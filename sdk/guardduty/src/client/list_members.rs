    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListMembers::max_results) / [`set_max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListMembers::set_max_results): <p>You can use this parameter to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. The default value is 50. The maximum value is 50.</p>

Set the value of this parameter to null on your first call to the list action. For subsequent calls to the action, fill nextToken in the request with the value of NextToken from the previous response to continue listing data.</p>

Member accounts must have been previously associated with the GuardDuty administrator account using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html"> <code>Create Members</code> </a>. </p>
