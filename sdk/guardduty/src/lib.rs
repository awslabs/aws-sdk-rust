//! <p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes
//! the following data sources: VPC flow logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event
//! logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, and Amazon EBS volume data.
//! It uses threat intelligence
//! feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify
//! unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment.
//! This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or
//! communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your
//! Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example, GuardDuty can detect
//! compromised EC2 instances and container workloads serving malware, or mining bitcoin. </p>
//! <p>GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for signs of compromise, such
//! as unauthorized infrastructure deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a Region
//! that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce
//! password strength. </p>
//! <p>GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web Services environment by producing
//! security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon EventBridge.
//! For more information, see the <i>
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html">Amazon
//! GuardDuty User Guide</a>
//! </i>. </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
