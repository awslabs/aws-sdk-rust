//! <p>DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
//! dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data from DynamoDB, so
//! applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You can create a DAX
//! cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few simple modifications to
//! your code, your application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize
//! significant improvements in read performance.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
