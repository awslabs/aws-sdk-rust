//! <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to
//! your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
//! two snapshots. If you’re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for
//! Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on
//! your Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
//! from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.</p>
//!
//! <p>You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the
//! cloud to use for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can
//! write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can
//! restore it back to Amazon Web Services or on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and
//! maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p>
//!
//!
//! <p>This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
//! parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that
//! make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
//! Guide</i>. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints,
//! and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas</a> in
//! the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/ebs).
