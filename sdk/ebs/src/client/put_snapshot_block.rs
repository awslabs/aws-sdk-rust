A block index is a logical index in units of <code>512</code> KiB blocks. To identify the block index, divide the logical offset of the data in the logical volume by the block size (logical offset of data/<code>524288</code>). The logical offset of the data must be <code>512</code> KiB aligned.</p>

As a result, you must generate and provide a Base64-encoded SHA256 checksum for the block data using the <b>x-amz-Checksum</b> header. Also, you must specify the checksum algorithm using the <b>x-amz-Checksum-Algorithm</b> header. The checksum that you provide is part of the Signature Version 4 signing process. It is validated against a checksum generated by Amazon EBS to ensure the validity and authenticity of the data. If the checksums do not correspond, the request fails.
