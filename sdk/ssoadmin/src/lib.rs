//! <p>Amazon Web Services Single Sign On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO
//! access to multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and business applications. This guide provides information on
//! SSO operations which could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about
//! Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On User Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>Many operations in the SSO APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as
//! principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in Amazon Web Services SSO,
//! see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Amazon Web Services SSO Identity Store API
//! Reference</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
