/// <p>Specifies the configuration of the AWS managed or customer managed policy that you want to set as a permissions boundary. Specify either <code>CustomerManagedPolicyReference</code> to use the name and path of a customer managed policy, or <code>ManagedPolicyArn</code> to use the ARN of an AWS managed policy. A permissions boundary represents the maximum permissions that any policy can grant your role. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html">Permissions boundaries for IAM entities</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important> 
/// <p>Policies used as permissions boundaries don't provide permissions. You must also attach an IAM policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html">IAM JSON policy evaluation logic</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
