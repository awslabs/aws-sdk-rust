//! <p>Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. By using Resource Explorer, you can
//! explore your resources using an internet search engine-like experience. Examples of
//! resources include Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, or Amazon DynamoDB
//! tables. You can search for your resources using resource metadata like names, tags, and
//! IDs. Resource Explorer can search across all of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your account in which you turn
//! the service on, to simplify your cross-Region workloads.</p>
//! <p>Resource Explorer scans the resources in each of the Amazon Web Services Regions in your Amazon Web Services account in which
//! you turn on Resource Explorer. Resource Explorer <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/getting-started-terms-and-concepts.html#term-index">creates
//! and maintains an index</a> in each Region, with the details of that Region's
//! resources.</p>
//! <p>You can <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html">search across all of the
//! indexed Regions in your account</a> by designating one of your Amazon Web Services Regions to
//! contain the aggregator index for the account. When you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region-turn-on.html">promote a local index
//! in a Region to become the aggregator index for the account</a>, Resource Explorer automatically
//! replicates the index information from all local indexes in the other Regions to the
//! aggregator index. Therefore, the Region with the aggregator index has a copy of all resource
//! information for all Regions in the account where you turned on Resource Explorer. As a result,
//! views in the aggregator index Region include resources from all of the indexed Regions in your
//! account.</p>
//! <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer, including how to enable and configure the
//! service, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/">Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide</a>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
