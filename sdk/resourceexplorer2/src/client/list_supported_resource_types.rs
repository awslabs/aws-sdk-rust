    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`ListSupportedResourceTypes`](crate::operation::list_supported_resource_types::builders::ListSupportedResourceTypesFluentBuilder) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::list_supported_resource_types::builders::ListSupportedResourceTypesFluentBuilder::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::list_supported_resource_types::builders::ListSupportedResourceTypesFluentBuilder::set_next_token): <p>The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a <code>NextToken</code> response in a previous request. A <code>NextToken</code> response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's <code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output should continue from.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::operation::list_supported_resource_types::builders::ListSupportedResourceTypesFluentBuilder::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::list_supported_resource_types::builders::ListSupportedResourceTypesFluentBuilder::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the <code>NextToken</code> response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.</p> <note>   <p>An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p>  </note>

You should repeat this until the <code>NextToken</code> response element comes back as <code>null</code>.</p>
