    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`Search`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::into_paginator).
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`query_string(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::query_string) / [`set_query_string(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::set_query_string): <p>A string that includes keywords and filters that specify the resources that you want to include in the results.</p>  <p>For the complete syntax supported by the <code>QueryString</code> parameter, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html">Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer</a>.</p>  <p>The search is completely case insensitive. You can specify an empty string to return all results up to the limit of 1,000 total results.</p> <note>   <p>The operation can return only the first 1,000 results. If the resource you want is not included, then use a different value for <code>QueryString</code> to refine the results.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the <code>NextToken</code> response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.</p> <note>   <p>An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`view_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::view_arn) / [`set_view_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::set_view_arn): <p>Specifies the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon resource name (ARN)</a> of the view to use for the query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the operation automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation. If the Region either doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to use the default view, then the operation fails with a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> exception.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search::builders::SearchFluentBuilder::set_next_token): <p>The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a <code>NextToken</code> response in a previous request. A <code>NextToken</code> response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's <code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output should continue from.</p>
                            /// - On success, responds with [`SearchOutput`](crate::operation::search::SearchOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`resources(Option<Vec<Resource>>)`](crate::operation::search::SearchOutput::resources): <p>The list of structures that describe the resources that match the query.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search::SearchOutput::next_token): <p>If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the <code>NextToken</code> response element comes back as <code>null</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`view_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search::SearchOutput::view_arn): <p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon resource name (ARN)</a> of the view that this operation used to perform the search.</p>
