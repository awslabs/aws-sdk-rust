/// <p>A complex type that contains optional Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) encryption settings for your Network Firewall resources. Your data is encrypted by default with an Amazon Web Services owned key that Amazon Web Services owns and manages for you. You can use either the Amazon Web Services owned key, or provide your own customer managed key. To learn more about KMS encryption of your Network Firewall resources, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-encryption-at-rest.html">Encryption at rest with Amazon Web Services Key Managment Service</a> in the <i>Network Firewall Developer Guide</i>.</p>
