/// <p>The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet. </p>
/// <p>For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, Network Firewall does the following: </p>

/// <li> <p>Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint.</p> </li>
