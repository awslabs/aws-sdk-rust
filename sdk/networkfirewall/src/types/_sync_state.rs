/// <p>The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet. </p> 
/// <p>For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, Network Firewall does the following: </p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic.</p> </li>
