//! <p>This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers who need
//! detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors. </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating
//! signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information
//! about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon Web Services APIs</a>. </p>
//! <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint:
//! <code>https://network-firewall.<region>.amazonaws.com </code>
//! </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to
//! the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see
//! <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step
//! instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network Firewall Developer
//! Guide</a>.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and
//! prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the
//! perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet
//! gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible
//! with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine.
//! Network Firewall supports Suricata version 5.0.2. For information about Suricata,
//! see the <a href="https://suricata-ids.org/">Suricata website</a>.</p>
//! <p>You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways.
//! The following are just a few examples: </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and
//! block all other forms of traffic.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your
//! applications can access.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the
//! port used.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in
//! Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p>
//! <ol>
//! <li>
//! <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in
//! Amazon VPC. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a
//! subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups,
//! to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and
//! specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and
//! VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you
//! specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall
//! endpoints.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ol>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
