Network Firewall returns a token to your requests that access the rule group. The token marks the state of the rule group resource at the time of the request. </p>  <p>To make changes to the rule group, you provide the token in your request. Network Firewall uses the token to ensure that the rule group hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has changed, the operation fails with an <code>InvalidTokenException</code>. If this happens, retrieve the rule group again to get a current copy of it with a current token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the operation again using the new token. </p>

    ///   - [`rules(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateRuleGroup::rules) / [`set_rules(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateRuleGroup::set_rules): <p>A string containing stateful rule group rules specifications in Suricata flat format, with one rule per line. Use this to import your existing Suricata compatible rule groups. </p> <note>   <p>You must provide either this rules setting or a populated <code>RuleGroup</code> setting, but not both. </p>  </note>  <p>You can provide your rule group specification in Suricata flat format through this setting when you create or update your rule group. The call response returns a <code>RuleGroup</code> object that Network Firewall has populated from your string. </p>

    ///   - [`dry_run(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateRuleGroup::dry_run) / [`set_dry_run(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateRuleGroup::set_dry_run): <p>Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to just check the validity of the request, rather than run the request. </p>  <p>If set to <code>TRUE</code>, Network Firewall checks whether the request can run successfully, but doesn't actually make the requested changes. The call returns the value that the request would return if you ran it with dry run set to <code>FALSE</code>, but doesn't make additions or changes to your resources. This option allows you to make sure that you have the required permissions to run the request and that your request parameters are valid. </p>  <p>If set to <code>FALSE</code>, Network Firewall makes the requested changes to your resources. </p>
