You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.</p>
    ///   - [`firewall_policy_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::firewall_policy_arn) / [`set_firewall_policy_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::set_firewall_policy_arn): <p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the <code>FirewallPolicy</code> that you want to use for the firewall.</p>

Each subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone in the VPC. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet. </p>
    ///   - [`delete_protection(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::delete_protection) / [`set_delete_protection(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::set_delete_protection): <p>A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A setting of <code>TRUE</code> indicates that the firewall is protected against deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this flag to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>

Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>

Use this setting to protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::description) / [`set_description(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::set_description): <p>A description of the firewall.</p>
    ///   - [`tags(Vec<Tag>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<Vec<Tag>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::set_tags): <p>The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.</p>
    ///   - [`encryption_configuration(EncryptionConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::encryption_configuration) / [`set_encryption_configuration(Option<EncryptionConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateFirewall::set_encryption_configuration): <p>A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your firewall resources.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`CreateFirewallOutput`](crate::output::CreateFirewallOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`firewall(Option<Firewall>)`](crate::output::CreateFirewallOutput::firewall): <p>The configuration settings for the firewall. These settings include the firewall policy and the subnets in your VPC to use for the firewall endpoints. </p>
