//! <fullname>Key Management Service</fullname>
//! <p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes
//! the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS,
//! see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/">
//! <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>
//! </a>.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p>
//! <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
//! languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a
//! convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example,
//! the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
//! retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to
//! download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
//! Services</a>.</p>
//! </note>
//! <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p>
//! <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with
//! Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the
//! available FIPS endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of
//! the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
//! <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security
//! (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also
//! support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
//! (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7
//! and later support these modes.</p>
//! <p>
//! <b>Signing Requests</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
//! recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your Amazon Web Services account (root) access key ID and
//! secret access key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret
//! access key for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to generate
//! temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p>
//! <p>All KMS operations require <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p>
//! <p>
//! <b>Logging API Requests</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your
//! Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the
//! information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made
//! the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it
//! on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>

//! <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful
//! for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating
//! keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>Encrypt</a>
//! </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>Decrypt</a>
//! </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>GenerateDataKey</a>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/kms).
