The address that you specify has to be verified. </p>
    ///   - [`destination(Destination)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::destination) / [`set_destination(Option<Destination>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::set_destination): <p>An object that contains the recipients of the email message.</p>

Tags correspond to characteristics of the email that you define, so that you can publish email sending events. </p>

This can happen when the message you're trying to send has an attachment doesn't pass a virus check, or when you send a templated email that contains invalid personalization content, for example.</p>  </note>
