Idempotency means that the request is successfully processed only once, even if you send the request multiple times. When a request succeeds, and you specify the same client token for subsequent successful requests, the IoT Greengrass V2 service returns the successful response that it caches from the previous request. IoT Greengrass V2 caches successful responses for idempotent requests for up to 8 hours.</p>
