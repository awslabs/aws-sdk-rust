When creating a subdeployment, the targetARN can only be a thing group.</p>

This is a dictionary, where each key is the name of a component, and each key's value is the version and configuration to deploy for that component.</p>

Idempotency means that the request is successfully processed only once, even if you send the request multiple times. When a request succeeds, and you specify the same client token for subsequent successful requests, the IoT Greengrass V2 service returns the successful response that it caches from the previous request. IoT Greengrass V2 caches successful responses for idempotent requests for up to 8 hours.</p>
