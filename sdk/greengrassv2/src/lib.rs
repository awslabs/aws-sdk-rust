//! <p>IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities
//! to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of
//! information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on
//! local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data
//! to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and
//! deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.</p>
//! <p>IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console.
//! Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components,
//! manage deployments, and core devices.</p>
//! <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html">What is IoT Greengrass?</a> in
//! the <i>IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/greengrassv2).
