# aws-sdk-greengrassv2

IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.

IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage deployments, and core devices.

For more information, see [What is IoT Greengrass?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html) in the _IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-greengrassv2` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-greengrassv2 = "0.0.0-local"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_greengrassv2 as greengrassv2;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), greengrassv2::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_greengrassv2::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-greengrassv2/latest/aws_sdk_greengrassv2/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
