description = "<p>AWS IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities\n      to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of\n      information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on\n      local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data\n      to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and components to create and\n      deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.</p>\n         <p>AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console.\n      Use this API reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components,\n      manage deployments, and core devices.</p>\n         <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/what-is-iot-greengrass.html\">What is AWS IoT Greengrass?</a> in\n      the <i>AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide</i>.</p>"
