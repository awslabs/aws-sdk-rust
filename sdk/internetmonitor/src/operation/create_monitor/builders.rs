/// <p>Creates a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. A monitor is built based on information from the application resources that you add: VPCs, Network Load Balancers (NLBs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon WorkSpaces directories. Internet Monitor then publishes internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the <i>city-networks</i>. That is, the locations and ASNs (typically internet service providers or ISPs), where clients access your application. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html">Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>When you create a monitor, you choose the percentage of traffic that you want to monitor. You can also set a maximum limit for the number of city-networks where client traffic is monitored, that caps the total traffic that Internet Monitor monitors. A city-network maximum is the limit of city-networks, but you only pay for the number of city-networks that are actually monitored. You can update your monitor at any time to change the percentage of traffic to monitor or the city-networks maximum. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/IMCityNetworksMaximum.html">Choosing a city-network maximum value</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p>
