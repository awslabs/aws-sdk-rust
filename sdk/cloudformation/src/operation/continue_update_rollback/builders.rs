/// <p>For a specified stack that's in the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state, continues rolling it back to the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed"> fix the error</a> and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state), and then try to update the stack again.</p> 
/// <p>A stack goes into the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state when CloudFormation can't roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.</p>
