//! <fullname>CloudFormation</fullname>
//! <p>CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure
//! deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage
//! Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store,
//! Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly
//! reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the
//! underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure.</p>
//! <p>With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template
//! file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack.
//! CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and
//! manages all dependencies between the resources for you.</p>
//! <p>For more information about CloudFormation, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation product page</a>.</p>
//! <p>CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need
//! additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find
//! the product's technical documentation at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">
//! <code>docs.aws.amazon.com</code>
//! </a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/cloudformation).
