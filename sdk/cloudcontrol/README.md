# aws-sdk-cloudcontrol

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Use Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API to create, read, update, delete, and list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that belong to a wide range of services--both Amazon Web Services and third-party. With the Cloud Control API standardized set of application programming interfaces (APIs), you can perform CRUD-L operations on any supported resources in your Amazon Web Services account. Using Cloud Control API, you won't have to generate code or scripts specific to each individual service responsible for those resources.

For more information about Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API, see the [Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-cloudcontrol` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.23-alpha"
aws-sdk-cloudcontrol = "0.0.23-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
