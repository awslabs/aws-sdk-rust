description = "<p>Use Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API to create, read, update, delete, and list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that\n      belong to a wide range of services--both Amazon Web Services and third-party.  With the Cloud Control API\n      standardized set of application programming interfaces (APIs), you can perform CRUD-L operations\n      on any supported resources in your Amazon Web Services account. Using Cloud Control API, you won't have to generate code\n      or scripts specific to each individual service responsible for those resources.</p>\n         <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html\">Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User\n        Guide</a>.</p>"
