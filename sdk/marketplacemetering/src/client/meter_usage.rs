The product code should be the same as the one used during the publishing of a new product.</p>
    ///   - [`timestamp(DateTime)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::timestamp) / [`set_timestamp(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::set_timestamp): <p>Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported. Your application can meter usage for up to one hour in the past. Make sure the <code>timestamp</code> value is not before the start of the software usage.</p>
    ///   - [`usage_dimension(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::usage_dimension) / [`set_usage_dimension(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::set_usage_dimension): <p>It will be one of the fcp dimension name provided during the publishing of the product.</p>

Defaults to <code>0</code> if not specified.</p>
    ///   - [`dry_run(bool)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::dry_run) / [`set_dry_run(Option<bool>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::set_dry_run): <p>Checks whether you have the permissions required for the action, but does not make the request. If you have the permissions, the request returns <code>DryRunOperation</code>; otherwise, it returns <code>UnauthorizedException</code>. Defaults to <code>false</code> if not specified.</p>
    ///   - [`usage_allocations(Vec<UsageAllocation>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::usage_allocations) / [`set_usage_allocations(Option<Vec<UsageAllocation>>)`](crate::operation::meter_usage::builders::MeterUsageFluentBuilder::set_usage_allocations): <p>The set of <code>UsageAllocations</code> to submit.</p>  <p>The sum of all <code>UsageAllocation</code> quantities must equal the <code>UsageQuantity</code> of the <code>MeterUsage</code> request, and each <code>UsageAllocation</code> must have a unique set of tags (include no tags).</p>
