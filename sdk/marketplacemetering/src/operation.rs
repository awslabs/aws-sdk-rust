/// <p>Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with

/// entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
/// required to call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive
/// usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of
/// RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions: metering and
/// entitlement.</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <i>Entitlement</i>: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the
/// customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS
/// Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container
/// image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against
/// unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
/// CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown
/// on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS
/// task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a
/// CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the
/// Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.</p>
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// <p>
/// <i>Metering</i>: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task,
/// per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum
/// of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
/// customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured
/// as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10
/// cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for
/// software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control
/// Plane -- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions,
/// other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The
/// AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for
/// running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers subscription
/// state, removing the need for your software to perform entitlement checks at
/// runtime.</p>
