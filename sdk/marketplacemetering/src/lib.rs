//! This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.
//!
//! AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.
//!
//! For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [AWS Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html) in the _AWS Marketplace Seller Guide._
//!
//! __Submitting Metering Records__
//!   - _MeterUsage_ - Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.
//!   - _BatchMeterUsage_ - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
//!
//! __Accepting New Customers__
//!   - _ResolveCustomer_ - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier along with the CustomerAWSAccountId and ProductCode.
//!
//! __Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products__
//!   - Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see [Container-Based Products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
//!
//! BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the _ [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html)._
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-marketplacemetering` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
//! aws-sdk-marketplacemetering = "1.21.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_marketplacemetering as marketplacemetering;
//!
//! #[::tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), marketplacemetering::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-marketplacemetering/latest/aws_sdk_marketplacemetering/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by AWSMarketplace Metering. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling AWSMarketplace Metering.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific values that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = ::aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`BatchMeterUsage`](crate::operation::batch_meter_usage) operation has
/// a [`Client::batch_meter_usage`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `send()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.batch_meter_usage()
///     .product_code("example")
///     .send()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
