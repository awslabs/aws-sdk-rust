//! <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>
//! <p>This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering
//! Service API.</p>
//! <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage
//! dimensions.</p>
//! <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i>
//! </p>
//! <p>
//! <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
//! </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace
//! product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS
//! or ECS.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of
//! customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
//! application.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>
//! <b>Accepting New Customers</b>
//! </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the
//! registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration
//! process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The
//! Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier
//! and Product Code.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>
//! <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>
//! </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p> Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
//! integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage
//! operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for
//! Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do
//! so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more
//! information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based Products</a>. </p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to
//! verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for
//! records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit
//! records over time. For more information, see the <i>
//! <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>
//! </i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate and not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
