//! This reference provides descriptions of the low-level Marketplace Metering Service API.
//!
//! Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.
//!
//! For information about the permissions that you need to use this API, see [Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide._
//!
//! __Submitting metering records__
//!
//! _MeterUsage_
//!   - Submits the metering record for an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product.
//!   - Called from: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or a container running on either Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
//!   - Supported product types: Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and containers
//!   - Vendor-metered tagging: Supported allocation tagging
//!
//! _BatchMeterUsage_
//!   - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by CloudTrail. You can use CloudTrail to verify that the software as a subscription (SaaS) metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html).
//!   - Called from: SaaS applications
//!   - Supported product type: SaaS
//!   - Vendor-metered tagging: Supports allocation tagging
//!
//! __Accepting new customers__
//!
//! _ResolveCustomer_
//!   - Resolves the registration token that the buyer submits through the browser during the registration process. Obtains a CustomerIdentifier along with the CustomerAWSAccountId and ProductCode.
//!   - Called from: SaaS application during the registration process
//!   - Supported product type: SaaS
//!   - Vendor-metered tagging: Not applicable
//!
//! __Entitlement and metering for paid container products__
//!
//! _RegisteredUsage_
//!   - Provides software entitlement and metering. Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services Marketplace must integrate with the Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation. Free and Bring Your Own License model (BYOL) products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage. However, you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information about using the RegisterUsage operation, see [Container-based products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
//!   - Called from: Paid container software products
//!   - Supported product type: Containers
//!   - Vendor-metered tagging: Not applicable
//!
//! __Entitlement custom metering for container products__
//!   - MeterUsage API is available in GovCloud Regions but only supports AMI FCP products in GovCloud Regions. Flexible Consumption Pricing (FCP) Container products arenâ€™t supported in GovCloud Regions: us-gov-west-1 and us-gov-east-1. For more information, see [Container-based products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).
//!   - Custom metering for container products are called using the MeterUsage API. The API is used for FCP AMI and FCP Container product metering.
//!
//! __Custom metering for Amazon EKS is available in 17 Amazon Web Services Regions__
//!   - The metering service supports Amazon ECS and EKS for Flexible Consumption Pricing (FCP) products using MeterUsage API. Amazon ECS is supported in all Amazon Web Services Regions that MeterUsage API is available except for GovCloud.
//!   - Amazon EKS is supported in the following: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, eu-west-2, eu-west-3, eu-north-1, ap-east-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-northeast-2, ap-south-1, ca-central-1, sa-east-1.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-marketplacemetering` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
//! aws-sdk-marketplacemetering = "1.90.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_marketplacemetering as marketplacemetering;
//!
//! #[::tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), marketplacemetering::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-marketplacemetering/latest/aws_sdk_marketplacemetering/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by AWSMarketplace Metering. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling AWSMarketplace Metering.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific values that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Builder`](crate::config::Builder) struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = ::aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_marketplacemetering::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// [builder pattern]: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/type-safety.html#builders-enable-construction-of-complex-values-c-builder
/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`BatchMeterUsage`](crate::operation::batch_meter_usage) operation has
/// a [`Client::batch_meter_usage`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `send()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.batch_meter_usage()
///     .product_code("example")
///     .send()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
