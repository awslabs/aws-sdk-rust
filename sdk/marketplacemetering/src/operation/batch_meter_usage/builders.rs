/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `BatchMeterUsage`.

/// <p><code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is called from a SaaS application listed on AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.</p>
/// <p>For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the same records or a subset of the input records.</p>
/// <p>Every request to <code>BatchMeterUsage</code> is for one product. If you need to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>.</p>
/// <p>Usage records are expected to be submitted as quickly as possible after the event that is being recorded, and are not accepted more than 6 hours after the event.</p>
/// <p><code>BatchMeterUsage</code> can process up to 25 <code>UsageRecords</code> at a time.</p>
/// <p>A <code>UsageRecord</code> can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers with usage data split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to define).</p>
/// <p><code>BatchMeterUsage</code> returns a list of <code>UsageRecordResult</code> objects, showing the result for each <code>UsageRecord</code>, as well as a list of <code>UnprocessedRecords</code>, indicating errors in the service side that you should retry.</p>
/// <p><code>BatchMeterUsage</code> requests must be less than 1MB in size.</p><note>
/// <p>For an example of using <code>BatchMeterUsage</code>, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-code-examples.html#saas-batchmeterusage-example"> BatchMeterUsage code example</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide</i>.</p>
