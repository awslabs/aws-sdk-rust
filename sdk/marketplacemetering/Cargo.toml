description = "<fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>\n        <p>This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering\n            Service API.</p>\n        <p>AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage\n            dimensions.</p>\n        <p>For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see\n            <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html\">AWS Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i> \n         </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>\n                    <i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace\n                    product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS\n                    or ECS.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>\n                    <i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of\n                    customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)\n                    application.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>\n            <b>Accepting New Customers</b>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>\n                    <i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the\n                    registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration\n                    process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The\n                    Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier\n                    and Product Code.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>\n            <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p> Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must\n                    integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage\n                    operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for\n                    Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do\n                    so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more\n                    information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html\">Container-Based Products</a>. </p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to\n            verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for\n            records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit\n            records over time. For more information, see the <i>\n               <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>\n            </i>.</p>"
