//! <p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable,
//! highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate,
//! run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code, 
//! you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software. </p>
//! <p>In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers, 
//! Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI. This API reference describes
//! the supported DDL operations in detail.</p>
//! <p>For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html">Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types 
//! in Amazon Keyspaces</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail">Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon Web Services APIs</a> in the <i>General Reference</i>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
