## Getting Started

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-servicecatalogappregistry` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.24-alpha"
aws-sdk-servicecatalogappregistry = "0.0.24-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
