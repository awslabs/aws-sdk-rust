# aws-sdk-servicecatalog

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

[AWS Service Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for AWS. To get the most out of this documentation, you should be familiar with the terminology discussed in [AWS Service Catalog Concepts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/what-is_concepts.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-servicecatalog` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.5.2"
aws-sdk-servicecatalog = "0.5.2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
