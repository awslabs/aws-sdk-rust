//! <p>Amazon Transcribe streaming offers three main types of real-time transcription:
//! <b>Standard</b>, <b>Medical</b>, and
//! <b>Call Analytics</b>.</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Standard transcriptions</b> are the most common option. Refer
//! to  for details.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Medical transcriptions</b> are tailored to medical professionals
//! and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient
//! dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of taking notes. Refer to
//! for details.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Call Analytics transcriptions</b> are designed for use with call
//! center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this
//! option. Refer to  for details.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/transcribestreaming).
