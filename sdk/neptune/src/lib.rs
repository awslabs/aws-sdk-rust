//! <fullname>Amazon Neptune</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it
//! easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of
//! Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for
//! storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon
//! Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query
//! languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that
//! efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as
//! recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network
//! security.</p>
//! 
//! <p>This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or
//! command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is
//! asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or
//! callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the
//! parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance
//! reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list
//! following some related topics from the user guide.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
