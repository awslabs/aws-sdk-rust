description = "<fullname>Amazon Neptune</fullname>\n         <p>Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it\n      easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of\n      Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for\n      storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon\n      Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query\n      languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that\n      efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as\n      recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network\n      security.</p>\n\n         <p>This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or\n      command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is\n      asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or\n      callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the\n      parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance\n      reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list\n      following some related topics from the user guide.</p>"
