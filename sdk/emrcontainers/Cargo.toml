description = "<p>Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run\n         open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). With\n         this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on\n         EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more\n         information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html\">What is Amazon EMR on EKS</a>.</p>\n         <p>\n            <i>Amazon EMR containers</i> is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS.
