# aws-sdk-emrcontainers

Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). With this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see [What is shared id="EMR-EKS"/>](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html).

_Amazon EMR containers_ is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The emr-containers prefix is used in the following scenarios:
  - It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, aws emr-containers start-job-run.
  - It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, "Action": [ "emr-containers:StartJobRun"]. For more information, see [Policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions).
  - It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR on EKS service endpoints. For example, emr-containers.us-east-2.amazonaws.com. For more information, see [Amazon EMR on EKSService Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/service-quotas.html#service-endpoints).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-emrcontainers` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-emrcontainers = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_emrcontainers as emrcontainers;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), emrcontainers::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_emrcontainers::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-emrcontainers/latest/aws_sdk_emrcontainers/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
