# aws-sdk-opsworks

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Welcome to the _AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference_. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.

AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the [AWS OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) details page.

__SDKs and CLI__

The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:
  - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
  - [AWS SDK for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html)
  - [AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm)
  - [AWS SDK for PHP 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html)
  - [AWS SDK for Ruby](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/)
  - [AWS SDK for Node.js](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/)
  - [AWS SDK for Python(Boto)](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html)

__Endpoints__

AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.
  - opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in the AWS console)
  - opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
  - opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com

__Chef Versions__

When you call CreateStack, CloneStack, or UpdateStack we recommend you use the ConfigurationManager parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see [Chef Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-opsworks` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.55.0"
aws-sdk-opsworks = "0.25.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_opsworks as opsworks;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), opsworks::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = opsworks::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-opsworks/latest/aws_sdk_opsworks/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
