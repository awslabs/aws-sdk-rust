description = "<p>Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. \n      One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this connection\n      in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the Cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 \n      and Amazon S3) and to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A \n      connection provides access to all Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. \n      Amazon Web Services resources in the China Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with those Regions.</p>"
