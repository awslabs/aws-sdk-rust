/// <p>Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the <code>DeleteConnection</code> request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an Direct Connect Partner is automatically converted to an interconnect.</p>

If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections. </p>
