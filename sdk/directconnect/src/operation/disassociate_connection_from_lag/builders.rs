The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the <code>DeleteConnection</code> request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG.

If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections. </p>
