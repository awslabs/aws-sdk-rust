You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Leave this parameter empty to retrieve capacity information for all fleets.</p>
    ///   - [`limit(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeFleetCapacity::limit) / [`set_limit(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeFleetCapacity::set_limit): <p>The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with <code>NextToken</code> to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.</p>

Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.</p>

    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeFleetCapacityOutput::next_token): <p>A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.</p>
