Use this parameter only when creating a build with files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that you own. The storage location must specify an Amazon S3 bucket name and key. The location must also specify a role ARN that you set up to allow Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket and your new build must be in the same Region.</p>  <p>If a <code>StorageLocation</code> is specified, the size of your file can be found in your Amazon S3 bucket.

This value determines the type of fleet resources that you use for this build. If your game build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating system. You must specify a valid operating system in this request. There is no default value.
