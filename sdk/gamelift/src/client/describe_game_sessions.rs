    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeGameSessions`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`fleet_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::fleet_id) / [`set_fleet_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_fleet_id): <p>A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve game sessions for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. </p>
    ///   - [`game_session_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::game_session_id) / [`set_game_session_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_game_session_id): <p>A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve. </p>
    ///   - [`alias_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::alias_id) / [`set_alias_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_alias_id): <p>A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to retrieve game sessions for. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value.</p>
    ///   - [`location(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::location) / [`set_location(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_location): <p>A fleet location to get game sessions for. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as <code>us-west-2</code>. </p>
    ///   - [`status_filter(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::status_filter) / [`set_status_filter(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_status_filter): <p>Game session status to filter results on. You can filter on the following states: <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>TERMINATED</code>, <code>ACTIVATING</code>, and <code>TERMINATING</code>. The last two are transitory and used for only very brief periods of time. </p>
    ///   - [`limit(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::limit) / [`set_limit(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_limit): <p>The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with <code>NextToken</code> to get results as a set of sequential pages.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeGameSessions::set_next_token): <p>A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`DescribeGameSessionsOutput`](crate::output::DescribeGameSessionsOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`game_sessions(Option<Vec<GameSession>>)`](crate::output::DescribeGameSessionsOutput::game_sessions): <p>A collection of properties for each game session that matches the request.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeGameSessionsOutput::next_token): <p>A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.</p>
