You can't change this property after you create the fleet. </p>  <p>Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition.</p> <note>   <p>ACM isn't available in all Amazon Web Services regions. A fleet creation request with certificate generation enabled in an unsupported Region, fails with a 4xx error.

This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in Amazon Web Services Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported Amazon Web Services Region as a remote location, in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as <code>us-west-2</code>. To create a fleet with instances in the home Region only, omit this parameter. </p>
