    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateScript`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder) operation.
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::set_name): <p>A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique. You can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateScript.html">UpdateScript</a> to change this value later. </p>
    ///   - [`version(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::version) / [`set_version(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::set_version): <p>Version information associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateScript.html">UpdateScript</a> to change this value later. </p>
    ///   - [`storage_location(S3Location)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::storage_location) / [`set_storage_location(Option<S3Location>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::set_storage_location): <p>The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the <code>ObjectVersion</code> parameter to specify an earlier version. </p>
    ///   - [`zip_file(Blob)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::zip_file) / [`set_zip_file(Option<Blob>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::set_zip_file): <p>A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.</p>  <p>When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: <code>--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`tags(Vec<Tag>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<Vec<Tag>>)`](crate::operation::create_script::builders::CreateScriptFluentBuilder::set_tags): <p>A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html"> Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. Once the resource is created, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html">TagResource</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html">UntagResource</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ListTagsForResource.html">ListTagsForResource</a> to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.</p>
