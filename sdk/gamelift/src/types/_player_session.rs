/// <p>Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is <code>RESERVED</code>) or actual player activity in a game session (when status is <code>ACTIVE</code>). A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.</p>
