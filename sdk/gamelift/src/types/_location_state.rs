/// <p>A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state object might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the location from the fleet.</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> <b>NEW</b> -- A new fleet location has been defined and desired instances is set to 1. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING</b> -- GameLift is setting up the new fleet location, creating new instances with the game build or Realtime script and starting server processes.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>ACTIVE</b> -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>ERROR</b> -- An error occurred when downloading, validating, building, or activating the fleet location.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>DELETING</b> -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet location request.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>TERMINATED</b> -- The fleet location no longer exists.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> <b>NOT_FOUND</b> -- The fleet location was not found. This could be because the custom location was removed or not created. </p> </li>
