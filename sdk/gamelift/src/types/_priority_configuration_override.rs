/// <p>An alternate list of prioritized locations for use with a game session queue. When this property is included in a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartGameSessionPlacement.html">StartGameSessionPlacement</a> request, the alternate list overrides the queue's default location priorities, as defined in the queue's <a href="gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html">PriorityConfiguration</a> setting (<i>LocationOrder</i>). The override is valid for an individual placement request only. Use this property only with queues that have a <code>PriorityConfiguration</code> setting that prioritizes <code>LOCATION</code> first.</p><note>
/// <p>A priority configuration override list does not override a queue's FilterConfiguration setting, if the queue has one. Filter configurations are used to limit placements to a subset of the locations in a queue's destinations. If the override list includes a location that's not on in the <code>FilterConfiguration</code> allowed list, Amazon GameLift won't attempt to place a game session there.</p>
