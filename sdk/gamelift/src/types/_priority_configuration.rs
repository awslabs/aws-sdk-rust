/// <p>Custom prioritization settings for a game session queue to use when searching for available game servers to place new game sessions. This configuration replaces the default FleetIQ prioritization process.</p>
/// <p>By default, a queue makes placements based on the following default prioritizations:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>If player latency data is included in a game session request, Amazon GameLift prioritizes placing game sessions where the average player latency is lowest. Amazon GameLift re-orders the queue's destinations and locations (for multi-location fleets) based on the following priorities: (1) the lowest average latency across all players, (2) the lowest hosting cost, (3) the queue's default destination order, and then (4), an alphabetic list of locations.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>If player latency data is not included, Amazon GameLift prioritizes placing game sessions in the queue's first destination. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session is placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically). Amazon GameLift re-orders the queue's destinations and locations (for multi-location fleets) based on the following priorities: (1) the queue's default destination order, and then (2) an alphabetic list of locations.</p></li>
