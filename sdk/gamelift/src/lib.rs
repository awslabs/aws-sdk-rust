//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>GameLift managed hosting -- GameLift offers a fully managed service to set up
//! and maintain computing machines for hosting, manage game session and player
//! session life cycle, and handle security, storage, and performance tracking. You
//! can use automatic scaling tools to balance player demand and hosting costs,
//! configure your game session management to minimize player latency, and add
//! FlexMatch for matchmaking.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Managed hosting with Realtime Servers -- With GameLift Realtime Servers, you can quickly configure
//! and set up ready-to-go game servers for your game. Realtime Servers provides a game server
//! framework with core GameLift infrastructure already built in. Then use the full
//! range of GameLift managed hosting features, including FlexMatch, for your
//! game.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>GameLift FleetIQ -- Use GameLift FleetIQ as a standalone service while hosting your games using EC2
//! instances and Auto Scaling groups. GameLift FleetIQ provides optimizations for game
//! hosting, including boosting the viability of low-cost Spot Instances gaming. For
//! a complete solution, pair the GameLift FleetIQ and FlexMatch standalone services.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>GameLift FlexMatch -- Add matchmaking to your game hosting solution. FlexMatch is a
//! customizable matchmaking service for multiplayer games. Use FlexMatch as
//! integrated with GameLift managed hosting or incorporate FlexMatch as a standalone
//! service into your own hosting solution.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>

//! <b>About this API Reference</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. With each topic
//! in this guide, you can find links to language-specific SDK guides and the Amazon Web Services CLI
//! reference. Useful links:</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
