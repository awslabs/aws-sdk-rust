/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateBuild`.
///
/// <p>Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Combine game server binaries into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift. </p> <important>
/// <p>When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the CLI command <b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html">upload-build</a> </b>. This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.</p>
/// </important>
/// <p>You can use the operation in the following scenarios:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To use this option, you give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html">Uploading Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Developer Guide</i>. After you upload build files to the GameLift Amazon S3 location, you can't update them. </p> </li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. A build must be in <code>READY</code> status before you can create fleets with it.</p>
