/// <p>Requests authorization to create or delete a peer connection between the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet and a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your Amazon Web Services account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. After you've received authorization, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringConnection.html">CreateVpcPeeringConnection</a> to establish the peering connection. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html">VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets</a>.</p>
/// <p>You can peer with VPCs that are owned by any Amazon Web Services account you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions.</p>
/// <p>To request authorization to create a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game servers to retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you want to peer with, and (2) the ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. If successful, VPC peering is authorized for the specified VPC. </p>
/// <p>To request authorization to delete a connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that is peered with your Amazon GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID of the Amazon Web Services account that you use to manage Amazon GameLift. </p>
/// <p>The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled. You must create or delete the peering connection while the authorization is valid. </p>
