/// <p>Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StopFleetActions.html">StopFleetActions</a>. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.</p>
/// <p>This operation can be used in the following ways:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>If successful, Amazon GameLift once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation will have no effect.</p>
