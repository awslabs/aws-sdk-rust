/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateGameServerGroup`.
/// 
/// <p> <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> 
/// <p>Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.</p> 
/// <p>Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following: </p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with your game server build. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html"> Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html">Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction</a> in the <i>GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric.</p> 
/// <p>Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.</p>
