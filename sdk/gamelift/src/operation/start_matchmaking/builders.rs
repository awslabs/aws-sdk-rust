/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `StartMatchmaking`.

/// <p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use Amazon GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers Amazon GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.</p>
/// <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>.</p>
/// <p>Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service, which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.</p>
