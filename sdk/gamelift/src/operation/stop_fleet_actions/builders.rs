/// <p>Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto-scaling activity. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. </p> 
/// <p>Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations. </p> 
/// <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend. </p> </li> 
/// </ul>
