/// <p>Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet instances, including those in remote locations, are shut down. You don't need to call <code>DeleteFleetLocations</code> separately.</p> <note> 
/// <p>If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html">CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization</a>. You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection.</p>

/// <p>To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process the fleet status is changed to <code>DELETING</code>. When completed, the status switches to <code>TERMINATED</code> and the fleet event <code>FLEET_DELETED</code> is sent.</p>
