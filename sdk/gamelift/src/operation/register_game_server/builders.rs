/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `RegisterGameServer`.
/// 
/// <p> <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> 
/// <p>Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track available game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server for a new game session. </p> 
/// <p>To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data.</p> 
/// <p>Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status <code>AVAILABLE</code>. A request to register a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance balancing or scale-down activity. </p>
