The position is resolved using HERE's Wi-Fi based solver.</p>

The position is resolved using HERE's cellular-based solver.</p>

The position is resolved using the GNSS solver powered by LoRa Cloud.</p>
    ///   - [`timestamp(DateTime)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetPositionEstimate::timestamp) / [`set_timestamp(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetPositionEstimate::set_timestamp): <p>Optional information that specifies the time when the position information will be resolved. It uses the UNIX timestamp format. If not specified, the time at which the request was received will be used.</p>
