//! <p>AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between internet-connected wireless
//! devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both LoRaWAN and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the
//! IoT Wireless API. These wireless devices use the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN)
//! communication protocol to communicate with AWS IoT.</p>
//! <p>Using the API, you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations for your wireless
//! devices, gateways, destinations, and profiles. After onboarding your devices, you
//! can use the API operations to set log levels and monitor your devices with CloudWatch.</p>
//! <p>You can also use the API operations to create multicast groups and schedule a multicast session for
//! sending a downlink message to devices in the group. By using Firmware Updates Over-The-Air
//! (FUOTA) API operations, you can create a FUOTA task and schedule a session to update the firmware
//! of individual devices or an entire group of devices in a multicast group.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
