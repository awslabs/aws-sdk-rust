Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Tag keys and values are case sensitive.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Do not use <code>aws:</code>, <code>AWS:</code>, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has <code>aws</code> as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of <code>aws</code> do not count against your tags per resource limit.</p> </li>  </ul>
