A replacement time series does not need to contain all rows that are in the baseline related time series. Include only the rows (measure-dimension combinations) that you want to include in the what-if forecast. This dataset is merged with the original time series to create a transformed dataset that is used for the what-if analysis.</p>  <p>This dataset should contain the items to modify (such as item_id or workforce_type), any relevant dimensions, the timestamp column, and at least one of the related time series columns. This file should not contain duplicate timestamps for the same time series.</p>  <p>Timestamps and item_ids not included in this dataset are not included in the what-if analysis. </p>
