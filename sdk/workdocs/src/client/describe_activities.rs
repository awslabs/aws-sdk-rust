Not required when using AWS administrator credentials to access the API.</p>
    ///   - [`start_time(DateTime)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::start_time) / [`set_start_time(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_start_time): <p>The timestamp that determines the starting time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed after the specified timestamp.</p>
    ///   - [`end_time(DateTime)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::end_time) / [`set_end_time(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_end_time): <p>The timestamp that determines the end time of the activities. The response includes the activities performed before the specified timestamp.</p>
    ///   - [`organization_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::organization_id) / [`set_organization_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_organization_id): <p>The ID of the organization. This is a mandatory parameter when using administrative API (SigV4) requests.</p>
    ///   - [`activity_types(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::activity_types) / [`set_activity_types(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_activity_types): <p>Specifies which activity types to include in the response. If this field is left empty, all activity types are returned.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::resource_id) / [`set_resource_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_resource_id): <p>The document or folder ID for which to describe activity types.</p>

The response includes activities pertaining to this user. This is an optional parameter and is only applicable for administrative API (SigV4) requests.</p>

An indirect activity results from a direct activity performed on a parent resource. For example, sharing a parent folder (the direct activity) shares all of the subfolders and documents within the parent folder (the indirect activity).</p>
    ///   - [`limit(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::limit) / [`set_limit(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeActivities::set_limit): <p>The maximum number of items to return.</p>
