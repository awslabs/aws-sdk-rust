Not required when using AWS administrator credentials to access the API.</p>

The response includes the activities performed after the specified timestamp.</p>
    ///   - [`end_time(DateTime)`](crate::operation::describe_activities::builders::DescribeActivitiesFluentBuilder::end_time) / [`set_end_time(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_activities::builders::DescribeActivitiesFluentBuilder::set_end_time): <p>The timestamp that determines the end time of the activities.

This is a mandatory parameter when using administrative API (SigV4) requests.</p>

If this field is left empty, all activity types are returned.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_activities::builders::DescribeActivitiesFluentBuilder::resource_id) / [`set_resource_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_activities::builders::DescribeActivitiesFluentBuilder::set_resource_id): <p>The document or folder ID for which to describe activity types.</p>

An indirect activity results from a direct activity performed on a parent resource. For example, sharing a parent folder (the direct activity) shares all of the subfolders and documents within the parent folder (the indirect activity).</p>
