//! <p>The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who
//! want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file system or
//! service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as
//! allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of
//! files.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have
//! additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
//! actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
//! changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary
//! actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the
//! application can also choose to email the user.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported,
//! such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or
//! record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to
//! replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed.
//! They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
//! IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By
//! creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM
//! user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as
//! set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file
//! permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three
//! use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis
//! using the IAM model.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
