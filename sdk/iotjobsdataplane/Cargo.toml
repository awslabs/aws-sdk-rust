description = "<p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to\n         and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a\n         set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform\n         remote troubleshooting operations.</p>\n         <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be\n         performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual\n         things, thing groups or both.</p>\n         <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the\n         execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its\n         progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and\n         for all the targets of the job</p>"
