# aws-sdk-iotjobsdataplane

IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to Amazon Web Services IoT Core. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.

Find the endpoint address for actions in the IoT jobs data plane by running this CLI command:

aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Jobs

The service name used by [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to sign requests is: _iot-jobs-data_.

To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or both.

IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to Amazon Web Services IoT Core. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the job

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-iotjobsdataplane` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-iotjobsdataplane = "1.89.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_iotjobsdataplane as iotjobsdataplane;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), iotjobsdataplane::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_iotjobsdataplane::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-iotjobsdataplane/latest/aws_sdk_iotjobsdataplane/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
