//! <p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs — remote operations that are sent to
//! and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a
//! set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform
//! remote troubleshooting operations.</p>
//! <p> To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be
//! performed, and you specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual
//! things, thing groups or both.</p>
//! <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the
//! execution of the job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its
//! progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and
//! for all the targets of the job</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
