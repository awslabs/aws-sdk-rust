The name must be from 1 to 255 characters. Container names must be unique to your AWS account within a specific region. As an example, you could create a container named <code>movies</code> in every region, as long as you don’t have an existing container with that name.</p>

These values can be anything that you want. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "environment") and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as "test," "development," or "production"). You can add up to 50 tags to each container.
