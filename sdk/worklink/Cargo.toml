description = "<p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access\n            to internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single step, your users, such as\n            employees, can access internal websites as efficiently as they access any other public website.\n            They enter a URL in their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email. Amazon WorkLink\n            authenticates the user's access and securely renders authorized internal web content in a secure\n            rendering service in the AWS cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on\n            mobile devices.</p>"
