Systems Manager supports the following types of OpsItems:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>/aws/issue</code> </p> <p>This type of OpsItem is used for default OpsItems created by OpsCenter. </p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>/aws/changerequest</code> </p> <p>This type of OpsItem is used by Change Manager for reviewing and approving or rejecting change requests. </p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>/aws/insights</code> </p> <p>This type of OpsItem is used by OpsCenter for aggregating and reporting on duplicate OpsItems. </p> </li>  </ul>

For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.</p> <important>   <p>Operational data keys <i>can't</i> begin with the following: <code>amazon</code>, <code>aws</code>, <code>amzn</code>, <code>ssm</code>, <code>/amazon</code>, <code>/aws</code>, <code>/amzn</code>, <code>/ssm</code>.</p>  </important>  <p>You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the <code>DescribeOpsItems</code> API operation) can view and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the <code>GetOpsItem</code> API operation).</p>  <p>Use the <code>/aws/resources</code> key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the <code>/aws/automations</code> key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems">Creating OpsItems manually</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>

For example:</p>  <p> <code>Key=Department,Value=Finance</code> </p> <important>   <p>To add tags to a new OpsItem, a user must have IAM permissions for both the <code>ssm:CreateOpsItems</code> operation and the <code>ssm:AddTagsToResource</code> operation.
