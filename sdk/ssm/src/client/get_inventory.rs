impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`GetInventory`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`filters(Vec<InventoryFilter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<InventoryFilter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::set_filters): <p>One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of results.</p>
    ///   - [`aggregators(Vec<InventoryAggregator>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::aggregators) / [`set_aggregators(Option<Vec<InventoryAggregator>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::set_aggregators): <p>Returns counts of inventory types based on one or more expressions. For example, if you aggregate by using an expression that uses the <code>AWS:InstanceInformation.PlatformType</code> type, you can see a count of how many Windows and Linux managed nodes exist in your inventoried fleet.</p>
    ///   - [`result_attributes(Vec<ResultAttribute>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::result_attributes) / [`set_result_attributes(Option<Vec<ResultAttribute>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::set_result_attributes): <p>The list of inventory item types to return.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::set_next_token): <p>The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetInventory::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`GetInventoryOutput`](crate::output::GetInventoryOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`entities(Option<Vec<InventoryResultEntity>>)`](crate::output::GetInventoryOutput::entities): <p>Collection of inventory entities such as a collection of managed node inventory. </p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::GetInventoryOutput::next_token): <p>The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are no additional items to return, the string is empty.</p>
    /// - On failure, responds with [`SdkError<GetInventoryError>`](crate::error::GetInventoryError)
