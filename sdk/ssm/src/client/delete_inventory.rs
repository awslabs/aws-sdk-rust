    ///   - [`schema_delete_option(InventorySchemaDeleteOption)`](crate::operation::delete_inventory::builders::DeleteInventoryFluentBuilder::schema_delete_option) / [`set_schema_delete_option(Option<InventorySchemaDeleteOption>)`](crate::operation::delete_inventory::builders::DeleteInventoryFluentBuilder::set_schema_delete_option): <p>Use the <code>SchemaDeleteOption</code> to delete a custom inventory type (schema). If you don't choose this option, the system only deletes existing inventory data associated with the custom inventory type. Choose one of the following options:</p>  <p>DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To enable this schema again, you must call the <code>PutInventory</code> operation for a version greater than the disabled version.</p>  <p>DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.</p>

This option is useful when you only want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that the data to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the same command without specifying the <code>DryRun</code> option.</p>
    ///   - [`client_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_inventory::builders::DeleteInventoryFluentBuilder::client_token) / [`set_client_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_inventory::builders::DeleteInventoryFluentBuilder::set_client_token): <p>User-provided idempotency token.</p>

    ///   - [`deletion_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_inventory::DeleteInventoryOutput::deletion_id): <p>Every <code>DeleteInventory</code> operation is assigned a unique ID. This option returns a unique ID. You can use this ID to query the status of a delete operation. This option is useful for ensuring that a delete operation has completed before you begin other operations. </p>
