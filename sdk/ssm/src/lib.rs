//! <p>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as
//! collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of
//! Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale.
//! Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed nodes. A
//! <i>managed node</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, or on-premises
//! server or virtual machine (VM) that has been configured for Systems Manager. </p>
//! <note>
//! <p>With support for IoT Greengrass core devices, the phrase <i>managed
//! instance</i> has been changed to <i>managed node</i> in most of the Systems Manager
//! documentation. The Systems Manager console, API calls, error messages, and SSM documents still use the
//! term <i>instance</i>.</p>
//! </note>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/ssm).

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
