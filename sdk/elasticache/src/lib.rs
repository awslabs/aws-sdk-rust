//! <fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate,
//! and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.</p>
//! <p>With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,
//! in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache.
//! The service makes setup, scaling,
//! and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.</p>
//! <p>In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch,
//! customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics
//! associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
