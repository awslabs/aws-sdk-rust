It indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining results, call <code>DescribeEvents</code> again, and assign the token from the previous results as the value of the <code>nextToken</code> parameter. If there are no more results, the response object's <code>nextToken</code> parameter value is <code>null</code>. Setting a <code>nextToken</code> value that was not returned in your previous results causes an <code>InvalidNextTokenException</code> to occur. </p>

If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a <code>NextToken</code> value that you can assign to the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter to get the next set of results. </p>
