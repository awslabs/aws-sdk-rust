For example, <code>arn:aws:opsworks-cm:us-west-2:123456789012:server/test-owcm-server/EXAMPLE-66b0-4196-8274-d1a2bEXAMPLE</code>.</p>

It indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining results, call <code>ListTagsForResource</code> again, and assign the token from the previous results as the value of the <code>nextToken</code> parameter. If there are no more results, the response object's <code>nextToken</code> parameter value is <code>null</code>. Setting a <code>nextToken</code> value that was not returned in your previous results causes an <code>InvalidNextTokenException</code> to occur.</p>

If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a <code>NextToken</code> value that you can assign to the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter to get the next set of results.</p>
