    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`ListTagsForResource`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListTagsForResource) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListTagsForResource::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`resource_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListTagsForResource::resource_arn) / [`set_resource_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListTagsForResource::set_resource_arn): <p>The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of an AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate or AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise server for which you want to show applied tags. For example, <code>arn:aws:opsworks-cm:us-west-2:123456789012:server/test-owcm-server/EXAMPLE-66b0-4196-8274-d1a2bEXAMPLE</code>.</p>

It indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining results, call <code>ListTagsForResource</code> again, and assign the token from the previous results as the value of the <code>nextToken</code> parameter. If there are no more results, the response object's <code>nextToken</code> parameter value is <code>null</code>. Setting a <code>nextToken</code> value that was not returned in your previous results causes an <code>InvalidNextTokenException</code> to occur.</p>

If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a <code>NextToken</code> value that you can assign to the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter to get the next set of results.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`ListTagsForResourceOutput`](crate::output::ListTagsForResourceOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`tags(Option<Vec<Tag>>)`](crate::output::ListTagsForResourceOutput::tags): <p>Tags that have been applied to the resource.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::ListTagsForResourceOutput::next_token): <p>A token that you can use as the value of <code>NextToken</code> in subsequent calls to the API to show more results.</p>
