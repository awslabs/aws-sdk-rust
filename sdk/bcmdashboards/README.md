# aws-sdk-bcmdashboards

Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management Dashboards is a service that enables you to create, manage, and share dashboards that combine multiple visualizations of your Amazon Web Services cost and usage data. You can combine multiple data sources including Cost Explorer, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instance metrics into unified dashboards, helping you analyze spending patterns and share cost insights across your organization.

You can use the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management Dashboards API to programmatically create, manage, and share dashboards. This includes creating custom dashboards, configuring widgets, managing dashboard permissions, and sharing dashboards across accounts in your organization.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-bcmdashboards` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-bcmdashboards = "1.5.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_bcmdashboards as bcmdashboards;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), bcmdashboards::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_bcmdashboards::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-bcmdashboards/latest/aws_sdk_bcmdashboards/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
