//! <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname>
//!
//! <p>A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances.
//! This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also
//! monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to
//! healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one
//! or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
//! clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for
//! connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used
//! when checking the health status of the targets.</p>
//!
//! <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load
//! Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This
//! reference covers the following load balancer types:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports
//! HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP,
//! TLS, and UDP.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//!
//! <p>For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User
//! Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//!
//!
//!
//!
//!
//!
//! <p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at
//! most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
