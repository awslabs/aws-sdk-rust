# aws-sdk-ssooidc

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.

__Considerations for Using This Guide__

Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.
  - The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)) that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed for native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in future releases.
  - The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For example, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.
  - The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.
  - The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service endpoints. For more information, see [GetRoleCredentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html) in the _IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide_.

For general information about IAM Identity Center, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the _IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ssooidc` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.54.1"
aws-sdk-ssooidc = "0.25.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust
use aws_sdk_ssooidc as ssooidc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), ssooidc::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = ssooidc::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-ssooidc/latest/aws_sdk_ssooidc/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
