//! <p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI
//! or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to
//! fetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with
//! IAM Identity Center.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
//! <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for
//! backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>
//! </note>
//! <p>
//! <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
//! important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0
//! Device Authorization Grant standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>) that are necessary to enable single
//! sign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed
//! for native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in
//! future releases.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For
//! example, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account
//! entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access
//! token into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service
//! endpoints. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! 
//! <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is
//! IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User Guide</i>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
