//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//! 
//! AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.
//! 
//! __Considerations for Using This Guide__
//! 
//! Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.
//!   - The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628)) that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed for native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in future releases.
//!   - The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For example, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.
//!   - The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.
//!   - The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service endpoints. For more information, see [GetRoleCredentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html) in the _IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide_.
//! 
//! For general information about IAM Identity Center, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the _IAM Identity Center User Guide_.
//! 
//! ## Getting Started
//! 
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//! 
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ssooidc` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//! 
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.0.0-smithy-rs-head"
//! aws-sdk-ssooidc = "0.25.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//! 
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//! 
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_ssooidc as ssooidc;
//! 
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), ssooidc::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = ssooidc::Client::new(&config);
//! 
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//! 
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-ssooidc/latest/aws_sdk_ssooidc/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//! 
//! ## Using the SDK
//! 
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
