//! <p>AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client
//! (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with AWS SSO. The service also
//! enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon successful authentication and
//! authorization with AWS SSO. This service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of
//! the device authorization grant standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>).</p>
//!
//! <p>For general information about AWS SSO, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS
//! Single Sign-On?</a> in the <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! <p>This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you can call
//! programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors.</p>
//!
//! <note>
//! <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
//! languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a
//! convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more
//! information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
