//! <fullname>IoT</fullname>
//! <p>IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
//! devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services
//! cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure
//! rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources
//! associated with each device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage
//! policies and credentials to authenticate devices.</p>
//! <p>The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas</a>.
//! You must use the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.</p>
//! <p>The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon Web Services
//! Signature Version 4</a> to sign the request is:
//! <i>execute-api</i>.</p>
//! <p>For more information about how IoT works, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html">Developer
//! Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>For information about how to use the credentials provider for IoT, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorizing-direct-aws.html">Authorizing Direct Calls to Amazon Web Services Services</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/iot).
