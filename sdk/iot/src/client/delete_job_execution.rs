Otherwise, you can only delete a job execution which is in a terminal state ("SUCCEEDED", "FAILED", "REJECTED", "REMOVED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.</p> <note>   <p>Deleting a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the device to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status.
