    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DeleteJobExecution`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`job_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::job_id) / [`set_job_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::set_job_id): <p>The ID of the job whose execution on a particular device will be deleted.</p>
    ///   - [`thing_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::thing_name) / [`set_thing_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::set_thing_name): <p>The name of the thing whose job execution will be deleted.</p>
    ///   - [`execution_number(i64)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::execution_number) / [`set_execution_number(Option<i64>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::set_execution_number): <p>The ID of the job execution to be deleted. The <code>executionNumber</code> refers to the execution of a particular job on a particular device.</p>  <p>Note that once a job execution is deleted, the <code>executionNumber</code> may be reused by IoT, so be sure you get and use the correct value here.</p>
    ///   - [`force(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::force) / [`set_force(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::set_force): <p>(Optional) When true, you can delete a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS". Otherwise, you can only delete a job execution which is in a terminal state ("SUCCEEDED", "FAILED", "REJECTED", "REMOVED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.</p> <note>   <p>Deleting a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the device to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`namespace_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::namespace_id) / [`set_namespace_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteJobExecution::set_namespace_id): <p>The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.</p>  <p>When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value in the following format.</p>  <p> <code>$aws/things/<i>THING_NAME</i>/jobs/<i>JOB_ID</i>/notify-namespace-<i>NAMESPACE_ID</i>/</code> </p> <note>   <p>The <code>namespaceId</code> feature is in public preview.</p>  </note>
