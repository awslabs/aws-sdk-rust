Otherwise, you can only delete a job which is in a terminal state ("COMPLETED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.</p> <note>   <p>Deleting a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which is executing the job to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that each device executing a job which is deleted is able to recover to a valid state.</p>  </note>
