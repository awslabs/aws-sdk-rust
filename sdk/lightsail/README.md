# aws-sdk-lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price.

You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).

This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see [Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-lightsail` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-lightsail = "1.24.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_lightsail as lightsail;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), lightsail::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_lightsail::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-lightsail/latest/aws_sdk_lightsail/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
