    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateContainerService`](crate::operation::create_container_service::builders::CreateContainerServiceFluentBuilder) operation.

The default domain of a container service is typically <code>https://   <servicename>    .    <randomguid>     .     <awsregion>      .cs.amazonlightsail.com     </awsregion>    </randomguid>   </servicename></code>. If the name of your container service is <code>container-service-1</code>, and it's located in the US East (Ohio) Amazon Web Services Region (<code>us-east-2</code>), then the domain for your container service will be like the following example: <code>https://container-service-1.ur4EXAMPLE2uq.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com</code> </p>  <p>The following are the requirements for container service names:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>Must be unique within each Amazon Web Services Region in your Lightsail account.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Must contain 1 to 63 characters.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Must contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.</p> </li>   <li> <p>A hyphen (-) can separate words but cannot be at the start or end of the name.</p> </li>  </ul>

The <code>power</code> and <code>scale</code> of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the <code>power</code> with the <code>scale</code> (the number of nodes) of the service.</p>  <p>Use the <code>GetContainerServicePowers</code> action to get a list of power options that you can specify using this parameter, and their base monthly cost.</p>

The <code>power</code> and <code>scale</code> of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the <code>power</code> with the <code>scale</code> (the number of nodes) of the service.</p>

The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service.</p>  <p>If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.</p> <important>   <p>You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the <code>CreateCertificate</code> action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.</p>  </important>  <p>You can specify public domain names using a string to array map as shown in the example later on this page.</p>

It also specifies the container that will serve as the public endpoint of the deployment and its settings, such as the HTTP or HTTPS port to use, and the health check configuration.</p>
