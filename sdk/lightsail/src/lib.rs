//! <p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes
//! everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers),
//! container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP
//! addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of
//! registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly
//! price.</p>
//!
//! <p>You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API,
//! AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts
//! and tasks, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! <p>This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
//! parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported
//! Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html">Amazon Lightsail Endpoints
//! and Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
