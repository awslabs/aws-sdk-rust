/// <p>Describes the delegation state of an Amazon Route&nbsp;53 registered domain to Amazon Lightsail.</p> 
/// <p>When you delegate an Amazon Route&nbsp;53 registered domain to Lightsail, you can manage the DNS of the domain using a Lightsail DNS zone. You no longer use the Route&nbsp;53 hosted zone to manage the DNS of the domain. To delegate the domain, Lightsail automatically updates the domain's name servers in Route&nbsp;53 to the name servers of the Lightsail DNS zone. Then, Lightsail automatically deletes the Route&nbsp;53 hosted zone for the domain.</p> 
/// <p>All of the following conditions must be true for automatic domain delegation to be successful:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>The registered domain must be in the same Amazon Web Services account as the Lightsail account making the request.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>The user or entity making the request must have permission to manage domains in Route&nbsp;53.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>The Route&nbsp;53 hosted zone for the domain must be empty. It cannot contain DNS records other than start of authority (SOA) and name server records.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>If automatic domain delegation fails, or if you manage the DNS of your domain using a service other than Route&nbsp;53, then you must manually add the Lightsail DNS zone name servers to your domain in order to delegate management of its DNS to Lightsail. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry">Creating a DNS zone to manage your domain’s records in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p>
