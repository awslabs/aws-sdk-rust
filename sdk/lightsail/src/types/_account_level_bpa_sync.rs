/// <p>Describes the synchronization status of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) account-level block public access (BPA) feature for your Lightsail buckets.</p> 
/// <p>The account-level BPA feature of Amazon S3 provides centralized controls to limit public access to all Amazon S3 buckets in an account. BPA can make all Amazon S3 buckets in an Amazon Web Services account private regardless of the individual bucket and object permissions that are configured. Lightsail buckets take into account the Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration when allowing or denying public access. To do this, Lightsail periodically fetches the account-level BPA configuration from Amazon S3. When the account-level BPA status is <code>InSync</code>, the Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration is synchronized and it applies to your Lightsail buckets. For more information about Amazon Simple Storage Service account-level BPA and how it affects Lightsail buckets, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-block-public-access-for-buckets">Block public access for buckets in Amazon Lightsail</a> in the <i>Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</i>.</p>
