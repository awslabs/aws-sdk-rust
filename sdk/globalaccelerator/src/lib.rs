//! <fullname>AWS Global Accelerator</fullname>
//! <p>This is the <i>AWS Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about
//! AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html">AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance
//! of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can
//! gain additional benefits. </p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications
//! that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS
//! global network. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you
//! can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <important>
//! <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the
//! US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.</p>
//! </important>
//! <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With
//! a standard accelerator, instead of using the
//! IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges
//! that you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator,
//! they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases
//! the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers,
//! Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing
//! accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that
//! are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p>
//! <important>
//! <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you
//! disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you
//! <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that
//! are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use
//! IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have
//! permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based policies</a>.</p>
//! </important>
//! <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based
//! on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to
//! changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always
//! directed to healthy endpoints.</p>
//! <p>For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS
//! Region Table</a>.</p>
//! <p>AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:</p>
//! <dl>
//! <dt>Static IP addresses</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge
//! network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you
//! can instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information,
//! see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html">
//! Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator</a>.</p>
//! <p>The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic
//! Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications,
//! you can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses
//! to access the resources.</p>
//! <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even
//! if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic.
//! However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the
//! static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route
//! traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions
//! with Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based policies</a>.</p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>Accelerator</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the
//! performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.</p>
//! <p>There are two types of accelerators:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>A <i>standard</i> accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based
//! on several factors, including the userâ€™s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights
//! that you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications.
//! Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>A <i>custom routing</i> accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of
//! Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private
//! clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to
//! statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which
//! allows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of
//! connection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC
//! subnet can't receive traffic. You can choose to configure all
//! destinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify
//! individual port mappings that can receive traffic.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-accelerator-types.html">Types of accelerators</a>.</p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>DNS name</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to
//! <code>a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com</code>, that points to
//! the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your
//! own IP address range. Depending on the use
//! case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to
//! route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using
//! your own custom domain name.</p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>Network zone</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an
//! AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure.
//! When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a
//! network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network
//! disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated
//! network zone.</p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>Listener</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range)
//! and protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each
//! listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded
//! to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you
//! want to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint
//! groups associated with a listener.</p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>Endpoint group</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or
//! more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of
//! traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a
//! setting called a <i>traffic dial</i>. The traffic dial lets
//! you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new
//! releases across different AWS Regions. </p>
//! </dd>
//! <dt>Endpoint</dt>
//! <dd>
//! <p>An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to.</p>
//! <p>Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP
//! addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for
//! standard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the
//! endpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint
//! weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers
//! that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one.
//! This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a
//! Region.</p>
//! <p>Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one
//! or many EC2 instances.</p>
