/// <p>Delete a cross-account attachment. When you delete an attachment, Global Accelerator revokes the permission to use the resources in the attachment from all principals in the list of principals. Global Accelerator revokes the permission for specific resources by doing the following:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>If the principal is an account ID, Global Accelerator reviews every accelerator in the account and removes cross-account endpoints from all accelerators.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>If the principal is an accelerator, Global Accelerator reviews just that accelerator and removes cross-account endpoints from it.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>If there are overlapping permissions provided by multiple cross-account attachments, Global Accelerator only removes endpoints if there are no current cross-account attachments that provide access permission. For example, if you delete a cross-account attachment that lists an accelerator as a principal, but another cross-account attachment includes the account ID that owns that accelerator, endpoints will not be removed from the accelerator.</p>
