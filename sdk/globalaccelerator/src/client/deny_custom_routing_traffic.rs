The value is TRUE or FALSE. </p>  <p>When set to TRUE, <i>no</i> destinations in the custom routing VPC subnet can receive traffic. Note that you cannot specify destination IP addresses and ports when the value is set to TRUE.</p>  <p>When set to FALSE (or not specified), you <i>must</i> specify a list of destination IP addresses that cannot receive traffic. A list of ports is optional. If you don't specify a list of ports, the ports that can accept traffic is the same as the ports configured for the endpoint group.</p>  <p>The default value is FALSE.</p>
