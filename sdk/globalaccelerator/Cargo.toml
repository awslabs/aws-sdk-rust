description = "<fullname>AWS Global Accelerator</fullname>\n\t\t       <p>This is the <i>AWS Global Accelerator API Reference</i>. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about\n\t\t\tAWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the \n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html\">AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>\n      \n\t\t       <p>AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance \n\t\t\tof your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can\n\t\t\tgain additional benefits. </p>\n\t\t       <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications \n\t\t\t\tthat are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS \n\t\t\t\tglobal network. </p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you \n\t\t\t\tcan use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n\t\t       <important>\n\t\t\t         <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the \n\t\t\t\tUS West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.</p>\n\t\t       </important>\n\t\t       <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With\n\t\t\ta standard accelerator, instead of using the \n\t\t\tIP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges \n\t\t\tthat you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator, \n\t\t\tthey distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases \n\t\t\tthe availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, \n\t\t\tAmazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing\n\t\t\taccelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that\n\t\t\tare virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <important>\n            <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you\n\t\t\t\tdisable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that\n\t\t\t\tare assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use\n\t\t\t\tIAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have\n\t\t\t\tpermissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html\">Tag-based policies</a>.</p>\n         </important>\n\t\t       <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based\n\t\t\ton health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to\n\t\t\tchanges in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always\n\t\t\tdirected to healthy endpoints.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <p>For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the \n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS \n\t\t\t\tRegion Table</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t       <p>AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:</p>\n\t\t       <dl>\n            <dt>Static IP addresses</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge\n\t\t\t\t\tnetwork. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you \n\t\t\t\t\tcan instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, \n\t\t\t\t\tsee <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLoad Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, \n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses \n\t\t\t\t\t\tto access the resources.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstatic IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttraffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html\">Tag-based policies</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n            <dt>Accelerator</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the\n\t\t\t\t\tperformance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>There are two types of accelerators:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <ul>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>A <i>standard</i> accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton several factors, including the userâ€™s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEndpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>A <i>custom routing</i> accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAmazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstatically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconnection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubnet can't receive traffic. You can choose to configure all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdestinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindividual port mappings that can receive traffic.</p>\n                  </li>\n               </ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-accelerator-types.html\">Types of accelerators</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n            <dt>DNS name</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to\n\t\t\t\t\t<code>a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com</code>, that points to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your\n\t\t\t\t\town IP address range. Depending on the use\n\t\t\t\t\tcase, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to\n\t\t\t\t\troute traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using\n\t\t\t\t\tyour own custom domain name.</p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n            <dt>Network zone</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an\n\t\t\t\t\tAWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a\n\t\t\t\t\tnetwork zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network\n\t\t\t\t\tdisruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated\n\t\t\t\t\tnetwork zone.</p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n            <dt>Listener</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) \n\t\t\t\t\tand protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each \n\t\t\t\t\tlistener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded \n\t\t\t\t\tto endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you \n\t\t\t\t\twant to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint \n\t\t\t\t\tgroups associated with a listener.</p>\n            </dd>\n            <dt>Endpoint group</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or\n\t\t\t\t\tmore endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of\n\t\t\t\t\ttraffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a\n\t\t\t\t\tsetting called a <i>traffic dial</i>. The traffic dial lets\n\t\t\t\t\tyou easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new\n\t\t\t\t\treleases across different AWS Regions. </p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n            <dt>Endpoint</dt>\n            <dd>\n               <p>An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP\n\t\t\t\t\t\taddresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstandard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tendpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRegion.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <p>Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor many EC2 instances.</p>\n\t\t\t\t        </dd>\n         </dl>"
