# aws-sdk-arcregionswitch

Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch helps you to quickly and reliably shift traffic away from an impaired Amazon Web Services Region to a healthy Region. With Region switch, you can create plans that define the steps to shift traffic for your application from one Amazon Web Services Region to another. You can test your plans in practice mode before using them in a real recovery scenario.

Region switch provides a structured approach to multi-Region failover, helping you to meet your recovery time objectives (RTOs) and maintain business continuity during regional disruptions.

For more information, see [Region switch in ARC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/region-switch.html) in the _Amazon Application Recovery Controller User Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-arcregionswitch` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-arcregionswitch = "1.7.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_arcregionswitch as arcregionswitch;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), arcregionswitch::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_arcregionswitch::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-arcregionswitch/latest/aws_sdk_arcregionswitch/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
