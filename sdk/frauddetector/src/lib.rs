//! <p>This is the Amazon Fraud Detector API Reference. This guide is for developers who need
//! detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API actions, data types, and errors. For
//! more information about Amazon Fraud Detector features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/frauddetector/latest/ug/">Amazon Fraud Detector User Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! <p>We provide the Query API as well as AWS software development kits (SDK) for Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and Python programming languages.</p>
//! <p>The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API provides HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verb GET or POST and a Query parameter <code>Action</code>. AWS SDK provides libraries,
//! sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request over
//! HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions that automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and
//! handling error responses, so that it is easier for you to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools to build on AWS</a>.

//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
