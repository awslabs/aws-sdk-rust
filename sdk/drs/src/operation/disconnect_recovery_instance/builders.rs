/// <p>Disconnect a Recovery Instance from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by Elastic Disaster Recovery for enabling the replication of the Recovery Instance will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. If the agent on the Recovery Instance has not been prevented from communicating with the Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive a command to uninstall itself (within approximately 10 minutes). The following properties of the Recovery Instance will be changed immediately: dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState will be set to DISCONNECTED; The totalStorageBytes property for each of dataReplicationInfo.replicatedDisks will be set to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.</p>
