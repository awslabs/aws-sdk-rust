//! <p>Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer
//! contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale.</p>
//! <p>Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing.
//! You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the
//! appropriate agents.</p>
//! <p>There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits
//! to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html">Amazon Connect
//! Service Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service by using an endpoint. For
//! a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html">Amazon Connect Endpoints</a>.</p>

//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
