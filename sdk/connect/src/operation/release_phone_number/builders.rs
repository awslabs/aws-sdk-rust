/// <p>To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the <code>ReleasePhoneNumber</code> API, not the Amazon Connect console.</p>
/// <p>After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown period of 30 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until the period has ended. If you accidentally release a phone number, contact Amazon Web Services Support.</p>
/// </important>
/// <p>If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired.</p>
/// <p>By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. </p>
/// <p>For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>
