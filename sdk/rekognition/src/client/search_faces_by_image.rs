    ///   - [`collection_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::collection_id) / [`set_collection_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::set_collection_id): <p>ID of the collection to search.</p>
    ///   - [`image(Image)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::image) / [`set_image(Option<Image>)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::set_image): <p>The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported. </p>  <p>If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the <code>Bytes</code> field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.</p>

The operation returns the maximum number of faces with the highest confidence in the match.</p>

For example, don't return any matches where confidence in matches is less than 70%. The default value is 80%.</p>
    ///   - [`quality_filter(QualityFilter)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::quality_filter) / [`set_quality_filter(Option<QualityFilter>)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::builders::SearchFacesByImageFluentBuilder::set_quality_filter): <p>A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't searched for in the collection. If you specify <code>AUTO</code>, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify <code>NONE</code>, no filtering is performed. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p>  <p>To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.</p>

    ///   - [`searched_face_confidence(Option<f32>)`](crate::operation::search_faces_by_image::SearchFacesByImageOutput::searched_face_confidence): <p>The level of confidence that the <code>searchedFaceBoundingBox</code>, contains a face.</p>
