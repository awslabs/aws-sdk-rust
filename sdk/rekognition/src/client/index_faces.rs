If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes isn't supported.</p> <p>If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the <code>Bytes</code> field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.</p><br>

A <code>DEFAULT</code> subset of facial attributes - <code>BoundingBox</code>, <code>Confidence</code>, <code>Pose</code>, <code>Quality</code>, and <code>Landmarks</code> - will always be returned. You can request for specific facial attributes (in addition to the default list) - by using <code>["DEFAULT", "FACE_OCCLUDED"]</code> or just <code>["FACE_OCCLUDED"]</code>. You can request for all facial attributes by using <code>["ALL"]</code>. Requesting more attributes may increase response time.</p> <p>If you provide both, <code>["ALL", "DEFAULT"]</code>, the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).</p><br>

The value of <code>MaxFaces</code> must be greater than or equal to 1. <code>IndexFaces</code> returns no more than 100 detected faces in an image, even if you specify a larger value for <code>MaxFaces</code>.</p> <p>If <code>IndexFaces</code> detects more faces than the value of <code>MaxFaces</code>, the faces with the lowest quality are filtered out first. If there are still more faces than the value of <code>MaxFaces</code>, the faces with the smallest bounding boxes are filtered out (up to the number that's needed to satisfy the value of <code>MaxFaces</code>). Information about the unindexed faces is available in the <code>UnindexedFaces</code> array.</p> <p>The faces that are returned by <code>IndexFaces</code> are sorted by the largest face bounding box size to the smallest size, in descending order.</p> <p><code>MaxFaces</code> can be used with a collection associated with any version of the face model.</p><br>

Filtered faces aren't indexed. If you specify <code>AUTO</code>, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The default value is <code>AUTO</code>. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify <code>NONE</code>, no filtering is performed.</p> <p>To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.</p><br>

Amazon Rekognition uses this orientation information to perform image correction - the bounding box coordinates are translated to represent object locations after the orientation information in the Exif metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata. The value of <code>OrientationCorrection</code> is null.</p></li>  <li>   <p>If the image doesn't contain orientation information in its Exif metadata, Amazon Rekognition returns an estimated orientation (ROTATE_0, ROTATE_90, ROTATE_180, ROTATE_270). Amazon Rekognition doesn’t perform image correction for images. The bounding box coordinates aren't translated and represent the object locations before the image is rotated.</p></li> </ul> <p>Bounding box information is returned in the <code>FaceRecords</code> array.
