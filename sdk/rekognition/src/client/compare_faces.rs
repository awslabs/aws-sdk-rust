Filtered faces aren't compared. If you specify <code>AUTO</code>, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>, filtering removes all faces that don’t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify <code>NONE</code>, no filtering is performed. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p>  <p>To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.</p>
