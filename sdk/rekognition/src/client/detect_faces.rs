A <code>DEFAULT</code> subset of facial attributes - <code>BoundingBox</code>, <code>Confidence</code>, <code>Pose</code>, <code>Quality</code>, and <code>Landmarks</code> - will always be returned. You can request for specific facial attributes (in addition to the default list) - by using [<code>"DEFAULT", "FACE_OCCLUDED"</code>] or just [<code>"FACE_OCCLUDED"</code>]. You can request for all facial attributes by using [<code>"ALL"]</code>. Requesting more attributes may increase response time.</p> <p>If you provide both, <code>["ALL", "DEFAULT"]</code>, the service uses a logical "AND" operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes).</p> <p>Note that while the FaceOccluded and EyeDirection attributes are supported when using <code>DetectFaces</code>, they aren't supported when analyzing videos with <code>StartFaceDetection</code> and <code>GetFaceDetection</code>.</p><br>
