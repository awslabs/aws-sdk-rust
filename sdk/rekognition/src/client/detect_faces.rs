This can be the default list of attributes or all attributes. If you don't specify a value for <code>Attributes</code> or if you specify <code>["DEFAULT"]</code>, the API returns the following subset of facial attributes: <code>BoundingBox</code>, <code>Confidence</code>, <code>Pose</code>, <code>Quality</code>, and <code>Landmarks</code>. If you provide <code>["ALL"]</code>, all facial attributes are returned, but the operation takes longer to complete.</p>  <p>If you provide both, <code>["ALL", "DEFAULT"]</code>, the service uses a logical AND operator to determine which attributes to return (in this case, all attributes). </p>

Amazon Rekognition uses this orientation information to perform image correction. The bounding box coordinates are translated to represent object locations after the orientation information in the Exif metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.</p>  <p>Amazon Rekognition doesn’t perform image correction for images in .png format and .jpeg images without orientation information in the image Exif metadata. The bounding box coordinates aren't translated and represent the object locations before the image is rotated. </p>
