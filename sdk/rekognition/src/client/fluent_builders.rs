/// <p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> 
/// <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> <note> 
/// <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> 
/// <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> 
/// <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> 
/// <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> 
/// <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> 
/// <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> 
/// <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p>

/// <p> <b>Optional Parameters</b> </p> 
/// <p>You can specify one or both of the <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES </code>will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color.</p> 
/// <p>When using <code>GENERAL_LABELS</code> and/or <code>IMAGE_PROPERTIES</code> you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/labels-detect-labels-image.html">Detecting Labels in an Image</a>.</p> 
/// <p>You can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels.</p> 
/// <p> <b>Response Elements</b> </p> 
/// <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information regarding labels:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> Name - The name of the detected label. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p> BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box. </p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p> The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s foreground. </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s background.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:</p> 
/// <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> 
/// <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> 
/// <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> 
/// <p>The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> 
/// <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> 
/// <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> 
/// <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> 
/// <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <note> 
/// <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <code>DetectFaces</code> operation provides.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p>
