    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`StartFaceSearch`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`video(Video)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::video) / [`set_video(Option<Video>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::set_video): <p>The video you want to search. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. </p>
    ///   - [`client_request_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::client_request_token) / [`set_client_request_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::set_client_request_token): <p>Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple <code>StartFaceSearch</code> requests, the same <code>JobId</code> is returned. Use <code>ClientRequestToken</code> to prevent the same job from being accidently started more than once. </p>

For example, don't return any matches where confidence in matches is less than 70%. The default value is 80%.</p>
    ///   - [`collection_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::collection_id) / [`set_collection_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::set_collection_id): <p>ID of the collection that contains the faces you want to search for.</p>
    ///   - [`notification_channel(NotificationChannel)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::notification_channel) / [`set_notification_channel(Option<NotificationChannel>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::set_notification_channel): <p>The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition Video to publish the completion status of the search. The Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name that begins with <i>AmazonRekognition</i> if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy to access the topic.</p>
    ///   - [`job_tag(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::job_tag) / [`set_job_tag(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartFaceSearch::set_job_tag): <p>An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notification that's published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you can use <code>JobTag</code> to group related jobs and identify them in the completion notification.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`StartFaceSearchOutput`](crate::output::StartFaceSearchOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`job_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::StartFaceSearchOutput::job_id): <p>The identifier for the search job. Use <code>JobId</code> to identify the job in a subsequent call to <code>GetFaceSearch</code>. </p>
