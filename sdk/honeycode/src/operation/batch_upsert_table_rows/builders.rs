/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `BatchUpsertTableRows`.
///
/// <p> The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or more rows in a table. The upsert operation takes a filter expression as input and evaluates it to find matching rows on the destination table. If matching rows are found, it will update the cells in the matching rows to new values specified in the request. If no matching rows are found, a new row is added at the end of the table and the cells in that row are set to the new values specified in the request. </p>
/// <p> You can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column is not explicitly specified for a particular row, then that column will not be updated for that row. To clear out the data in a specific cell, you need to set the value as an empty string (""). </p>
