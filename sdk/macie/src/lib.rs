//! <fullname>Amazon Macie Classic</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Macie Classic has been discontinued and is no longer available.</p>
//!
//! <p>A new Amazon Macie is now available with significant design improvements and additional
//! features, at a lower price and in most Amazon Web Services Regions. We encourage you to take advantage of the
//! new and improved features, and benefit from the reduced cost. To learn about features and pricing for the new Macie, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/macie/">Amazon Macie</a>. To learn how to use the new Macie, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/what-is-macie.html">Amazon Macie User

//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
