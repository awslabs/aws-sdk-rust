# aws-sdk-apigatewaymanagement

The Amazon API Gateway Management API allows you to directly manage runtime aspects of your deployed APIs. To use it, you must explicitly set the SDK's endpoint to point to the endpoint of your deployed API. The endpoint will be of the form https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}, or will be the endpoint corresponding to your API's custom domain and base path, if applicable.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-apigatewaymanagement` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-apigatewaymanagement = "1.21.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_apigatewaymanagement as apigatewaymanagement;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), apigatewaymanagement::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_apigatewaymanagement::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-apigatewaymanagement/latest/aws_sdk_apigatewaymanagement/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
