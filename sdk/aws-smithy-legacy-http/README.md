# aws-smithy-legacy-http

**This is a legacy crate that provides support for `http@0.x` and `hyper@0.x`.**

Core HTTP primitives for service clients generated by [smithy-rs](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs) including:
- HTTP Body implementation
- Endpoint support
- HTTP header deserialization
- Event streams
- `ByteStream`: _(supported on crate feature `rt-tokio` only)_ a misuse-resistant abstraction for streaming binary data

## Usage

This crate is used when generating server SDKs without the `http-1x` codegen flag. For new projects, prefer using `aws-smithy-http` which supports `http@1.x` and `hyper@1.x`.
