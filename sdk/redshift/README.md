# aws-sdk-redshift

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

__Overview__

This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html).

Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.

If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the [Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html).

If you are a database developer, the [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html) explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-redshift` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.55.0"
aws-sdk-redshift = "0.25.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_redshift as redshift;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), redshift::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = redshift::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-redshift/latest/aws_sdk_redshift/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
