//! <fullname>Amazon Redshift</fullname>
//! <p>
//! <b>Overview</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of
//! the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters.
//! Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require
//! techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a
//! command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether
//! a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next
//! maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using the
//! Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.</p>
//! <p>Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data
//! warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying
//! patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to
//! acquire new insights for your business and customers.</p>
//! <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading
//! the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html">Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>
//! 
//! <p>If you are a database developer, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design,
//! build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse. </p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
