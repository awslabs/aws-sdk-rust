If no identifier is specified, information is returned for all HSM configurations owned by your Amazon Web Services account.</p>

If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified <code>MaxRecords</code> value, a value is returned in a <code>marker</code> field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value. </p>  <p>Default: <code>100</code> </p>  <p>Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.</p>

When the results of a <code>DescribeHsmConfigurations</code> request exceed the value specified in <code>MaxRecords</code>, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the <code>Marker</code> field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the <code>Marker</code> parameter and retrying the request. </p>

For example, suppose that you have HSM configurations that are tagged with keys called <code>owner</code> and <code>environment</code>. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the HSM configurations that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.</p>

For example, suppose that you have HSM configurations that are tagged with values called <code>admin</code> and <code>test</code>. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the HSM configurations that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.</p>
