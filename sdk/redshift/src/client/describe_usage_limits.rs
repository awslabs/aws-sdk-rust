    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeUsageLimits`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`usage_limit_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits::usage_limit_id) / [`set_usage_limit_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits::set_usage_limit_id): <p>The identifier of the usage limit to describe.</p>
    ///   - [`cluster_identifier(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits::cluster_identifier) / [`set_cluster_identifier(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeUsageLimits::set_cluster_identifier): <p>The identifier of the cluster for which you want to describe usage limits.</p>

If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified <code>MaxRecords</code> value, a value is returned in a <code>marker</code> field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value. </p>  <p>Default: <code>100</code> </p>  <p>Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.</p>

When the results of a <code>DescribeUsageLimits</code> request exceed the value specified in <code>MaxRecords</code>, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the <code>Marker</code> field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the <code>Marker</code> parameter and retrying the request. </p>

For example, suppose that you have parameter groups that are tagged with keys called <code>owner</code> and <code>environment</code>. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the usage limit objects have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.</p>

For example, suppose that you have parameter groups that are tagged with values called <code>admin</code> and <code>test</code>. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the usage limit objects that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.</p>
