//! <fullname>AWS CodeStar Connections</fullname>
//! <p>This AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of
//! the operations and data types for the AWS CodeStar Connections API. You can use the
//! connections API to work with connections and installations.</p>
//! <p>
//! <i>Connections</i> are configurations that you use to connect AWS
//! resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to
//! services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For
//! example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a
//! code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and
//! associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection.</p>
//! <p>When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake.
//! <i>Installations</i> are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For
//! example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you
//! create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one.</p>
//! <p>When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub
//! Enterprise Server, you create a <i>host</i> for your connections.</p>
//! <p>You can work with connections by calling:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>CreateConnection</a>, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be
//! referenced by services such as CodePipeline.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>DeleteConnection</a>, which deletes the specified connection.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>GetConnection</a>, which returns information about the connection, including
//! the connection status.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>ListConnections</a>, which lists the connections associated with your
//! account.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>You can work with hosts by calling:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>CreateHost</a>, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure where your provider is installed.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>DeleteHost</a>, which deletes the specified host.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>GetHost</a>, which returns information about the host, including
//! the setup status.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>ListHosts</a>, which lists the hosts associated with your
//! account.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the following:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>ListTagsForResource</a>, which gets information about AWS tags for a
//! specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>TagResource</a>, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar
//! Connections.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <a>UntagResource</a>, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar
//! Connections.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/welcome-connections.html">Developer Tools User
//! Guide</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
