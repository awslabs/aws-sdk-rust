Domain names are not case sensitive.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Numbers 0 through 9.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label. </p> </li>   <li> <p>Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the <code>.</code> in <code>example.com</code>.</p> </li>  </ul>  <p>Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains.
