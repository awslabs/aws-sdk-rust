    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`caller_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::caller_id) / [`set_caller_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::set_caller_id): The phone number that appears on recipients' devices when they receive the message.
    ///   - [`configuration_set_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::configuration_set_name) / [`set_configuration_set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::set_configuration_set_name): The name of the configuration set that you want to use to send the message.
    ///   - [`content(VoiceMessageContent)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::content) / [`set_content(Option<VoiceMessageContent>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendVoiceMessage::set_content): An object that contains a voice message and information about the recipient that you want to send it to.

This isn't necessarily the phone number that appears on recipients' devices when they receive the message, because you can specify a CallerId parameter in the request.
