/// <p>Deletes an accessor that your Amazon Web Services account owns. An accessor object is a container that has the information required for token based access to your Ethereum nodes including, the <code>BILLING_TOKEN</code>. After an accessor is deleted, the status of the accessor changes from <code>AVAILABLE</code> to <code>PENDING_DELETION</code>. An accessor in the <code>PENDING_DELETION</code> state can’t be used for new WebSocket requests or HTTP requests. However, WebSocket connections that were initiated while the accessor was in the <code>AVAILABLE</code> state remain open until they expire (up to 2 hours).</p>
