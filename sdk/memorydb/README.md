# aws-sdk-memorydb

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

MemoryDB for Redis is a fully managed, Redis-compatible, in-memory database that delivers ultra-fast performance and Multi-AZ durability for modern applications built using microservices architectures. MemoryDB stores the entire database in-memory, enabling low latency and high throughput data access. It is compatible with Redis, a popular open source data store, enabling you to leverage Redis’ flexible and friendly data structures, APIs, and commands.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-memorydb` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.14.0"
aws-sdk-memorydb = "0.14.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
