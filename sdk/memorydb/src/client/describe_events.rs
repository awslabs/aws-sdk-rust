    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

If not specified, all sources are included in the response.</p>
    ///   - [`source_type(SourceType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::source_type) / [`set_source_type(Option<SourceType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::set_source_type): <p>The event source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified, all events are returned.</p>
    ///   - [`start_time(DateTime)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::start_time) / [`set_start_time(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::set_start_time): <p>The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z</p>

Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z</p>
    ///   - [`duration(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::duration) / [`set_duration(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeEvents::set_duration): <p>The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.</p>

If more records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a token is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.</p>
