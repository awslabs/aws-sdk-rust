//! <fullname>Identity and Access Management</fullname>
//! <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling
//! access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials
//! such as access keys, and permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and
//! applications can access. For more information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Identity and Access Management User Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/iam).
