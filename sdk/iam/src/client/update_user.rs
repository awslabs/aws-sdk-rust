Include this parameter only if you're changing the user's path.</p>  <p>This parameter allows (through its <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex">regex pattern</a>) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the !
