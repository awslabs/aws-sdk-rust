You use a string similar to a URL but without the http:// in front. For example: <code>elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com</code>. </p>  <p>Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact service principal for your service-linked role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">Amazon Web Services services that work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. Look for the services that have <b>Yes </b>in the <b>Service-Linked Role</b> column. Choose the <b>Yes</b> link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.</p>
    ///   - [`description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateServiceLinkedRole::description) / [`set_description(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateServiceLinkedRole::set_description): <p>The description of the role.</p>

If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different <code>CustomSuffix</code> for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add <code>-1</code> or <code>-debug</code> to the suffix.</p>  <p>Some services do not support the <code>CustomSuffix</code> parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.</p>
