Provide the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last attempted to access the specified service.</p>  <p>To learn the service namespace for a service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html">Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, <code>(service prefix: a4b)</code>. For more information about service namespaces, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces">Amazon Web Services service namespaces</a> in the&nbsp;<i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>

Note that IAM might return fewer than the <code>MaxItems</code> number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check <code>IsTruncated</code> after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.</p>
