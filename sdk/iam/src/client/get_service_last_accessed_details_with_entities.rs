Provide the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last attempted to access the specified service.</p>  <p>To learn the service namespace for a service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html">Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, <code>(service prefix: a4b)</code>. For more information about service namespaces, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces">Amazon Web Services service namespaces</a> in the&nbsp;<i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>

If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response element is <code>true</code>.</p>  <p>If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the <code>IsTruncated</code> response element returns <code>true</code>, and <code>Marker</code> contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.</p>

Set it to the value of the <code>Marker</code> element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.</p>

    ///   - [`is_truncated(bool)`](crate::operation::get_service_last_accessed_details_with_entities::GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntitiesOutput::is_truncated): <p>A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the <code>Marker</code> request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the <code>MaxItems</code> number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check <code>IsTruncated</code> after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.</p>
