The new password must conform to the Amazon Web Services account's password policy, if one exists.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex">regex pattern</a> that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (<code>\u0020</code>) through the end of the ASCII character range (<code>\u00FF</code>). You can also include the tab (<code>\u0009</code>), line feed (<code>\u000A</code>), and carriage return (<code>\u000D</code>) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Amazon Web Services Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.</p>
