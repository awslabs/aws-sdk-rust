/// <p>Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization.</p>
/// <p>To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Refining permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.</p>
/// <p>You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.</p>
/// <p>For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Reducing permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <important>
/// <p>The data includes&nbsp;all&nbsp;attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.
