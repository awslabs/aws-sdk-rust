/// <p>Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine the policies' effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account.</p> 
/// <p>You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use <code>SimulateCustomPolicy</code> instead.</p> 
/// <p>You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.</p> 
/// <p>The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the operations.</p> 
/// <p> <b>Note:</b> This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use <code>SimulateCustomPolicy</code> instead.</p> 
/// <p>Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the <code>Condition</code> element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use <code>GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy</code>.</p> 
/// <p>If the output is long, you can use the <code>MaxItems</code> and <code>Marker</code> parameters to paginate the results.</p>
