/// <p>Generates a report that includes details about when an IAM resource (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an attempt to access Amazon Web Services services. Recent activity usually appears within four hours. IAM reports activity for at least the last 400 days, or less if your Region began supporting this feature within the last year. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period">Regions where data is tracked</a>.</p> <important>
/// <p>The service last accessed data includes&nbsp;all&nbsp;attempts to access an Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that your account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html">Logging IAM events with CloudTrail</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>

/// <p>The <code>GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> operation returns a <code>JobId</code>. Use this parameter in the following operations to retrieve the following details from your report: </p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p> <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> – Use this operation for users, groups, roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt.</p> <p>The <code>JobId</code> returned by <code>GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail</code> must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetail</code>.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p> <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities</code> – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Services service. </p> </li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>To check the status of the <code>GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> request, use the <code>JobId</code> parameter in the same operations and test the <code>JobStatus</code> response parameter.</p>
/// <p>For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the <code>ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess</code> operation.</p> <note>
/// <p>Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics">Evaluating policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
