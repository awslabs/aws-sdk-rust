/// <p>You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from an Availability Zone in a AWS Region, to help your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment or from an AWS infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your account in an AWS Region. Resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC by AWS services.</p> 
/// <p>At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.</p> 
/// <p>When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short time, typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the Availability Zone to complete.</p>
