//! <p>This is the API Reference Guide for the zonal shift feature of Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about 
//! zonal shift API actions, data types, and errors.</p>
//! <p>Zonal shift is in preview release for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller and is subject to change.</p>
//! <p>Zonal shift in Route 53 ARC enables you to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone. Starting 
//! a zonal shift helps your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code deployment 
//! or from an AWS infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone, reducing the impact and time lost from an issue 
//! in one zone. </p>
//! <p>Supported AWS resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC. Resources that are registered for zonal shifts 
//! in Route 53 ARC are managed resources in Route 53 ARC. You can start a zonal shift for any managed resource in your account in a Region. 
//! At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.</p>
//! <p>Zonal shifts are temporary. You must specify an expiration when you start a zonal shift, of up to three days initially. 
//! If you want to still keep traffic away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new expiration. 
//! You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example, if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.</p>
//! <p>For more information about using zonal shift, see the 
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide</a>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
