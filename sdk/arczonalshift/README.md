# aws-sdk-arczonalshift

Welcome to the API Reference Guide for zonal shift and zonal autoshift in Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC).

You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.

You can also configure zonal autoshift for supported load balancer resources. Zonal autoshift is a capability in ARC where you authorize Amazon Web Services to shift away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone during events, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery. Amazon Web Services starts an autoshift when internal telemetry indicates that there is an Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact customers.

For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the [Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-arczonalshift` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-arczonalshift = "1.92.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_arczonalshift as arczonalshift;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), arczonalshift::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_arczonalshift::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-arczonalshift/latest/aws_sdk_arczonalshift/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
