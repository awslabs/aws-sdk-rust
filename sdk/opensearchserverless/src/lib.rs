//! <p>Use the Amazon OpenSearch Serverless API to create, configure, and manage OpenSearch Serverless collections and
//! security policies.</p>
//! <p>OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand, pre-provisioned serverless configuration for
//! Amazon OpenSearch Service. OpenSearch Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning,
//! configuring, and tuning your OpenSearch clusters. It enables you to easily search and
//! analyze petabytes of data without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure
//! and data management.</p>
//! <p> To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html">What is
//! Amazon OpenSearch Serverless?</a>
//! </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
