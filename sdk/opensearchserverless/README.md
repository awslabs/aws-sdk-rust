# aws-sdk-opensearchserverless

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Use the Amazon OpenSearch Serverless API to create, configure, and manage OpenSearch Serverless collections and security policies.

OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand, pre-provisioned serverless configuration for Amazon OpenSearch Service. OpenSearch Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and tuning your OpenSearch clusters. It enables you to easily search and analyze petabytes of data without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and data management.

To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see [What is Amazon OpenSearch Serverless?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html)

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-opensearchserverless` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.54.1"
aws-sdk-opensearchserverless = "0.3.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust
use aws_sdk_opensearchserverless as opensearchserverless;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), opensearchserverless::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = opensearchserverless::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-opensearchserverless/latest/aws_sdk_opensearchserverless/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
