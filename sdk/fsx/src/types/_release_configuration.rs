/// <p>The configuration that specifies a minimum amount of time since last access for an exported file to be eligible for release from an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Only files that were last accessed before this point-in-time can be released. For example, if you specify a last accessed time criteria of 9 days, only files that were last accessed 9.00001 or more days ago can be released.</p>
/// <p>Only file data that has been exported to S3 can be released. Files that have not yet been exported to S3, such as new or changed files that have not been exported, are not eligible for release. When files are released, their metadata stays on the file system, so they can still be accessed later. Users and applications can access a released file by reading the file again, which restores data from Amazon S3 to the FSx for Lustre file system.</p><note>
/// <p>If a file meets the last accessed time criteria, its file or directory path must also be specified with the <code>Paths</code> parameter of the operation in order for the file to be released.</p>
