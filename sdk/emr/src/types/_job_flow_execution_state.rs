/// When writing a match expression against `JobFlowExecutionState`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let jobflowexecutionstate = unimplemented!();
/// match jobflowexecutionstate {
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Bootstrapping => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Completed => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Failed => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Running => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::ShuttingDown => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Starting => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Terminated => { /* ... */ },
///     JobFlowExecutionState::Waiting => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `jobflowexecutionstate` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `JobFlowExecutionState::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `JobFlowExecutionState::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `JobFlowExecutionState::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `jobflowexecutionstate` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `JobFlowExecutionState::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// <p>The type of instance.</p>
