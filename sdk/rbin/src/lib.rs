//! <p>This is the <i>Recycle Bin API Reference</i>. This documentation provides
//! descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle Bin.</p>
//!
//! <p>Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally
//! deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are
//! deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify.</p>
//!
//! <p>You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period
//! expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the
//! Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same way you use any other resource of that type
//! in your account. If the retention period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource
//! is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more
//! information about Recycle Bin, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-recycle-bin.html">
//! Recycle Bin</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
