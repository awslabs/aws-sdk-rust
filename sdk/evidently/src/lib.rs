//! <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage
//! of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature
//! to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you
//! reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.</p>
//! <p>You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence
//! and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects
//! experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear
//! recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features
//! and backend features.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
