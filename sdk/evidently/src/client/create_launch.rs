    ///   - [`project(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::project) / [`set_project(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::set_project): <p>The name or ARN of the project that you want to create the launch in.</p>
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::set_name): <p>The name for the new launch.</p>
    ///   - [`description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::description) / [`set_description(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::set_description): <p>An optional description for the launch.</p>

This randomization ID is a combination of the entity ID and <code>randomizationSalt</code>. If you omit <code>randomizationSalt</code>, Evidently uses the launch name as the <code>randomizationSalt</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`tags(HashMap<String, String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateLaunch::set_tags): <p>Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the launch.</p>  <p>Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.</p>  <p>Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.</p>  <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with a launch.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>
