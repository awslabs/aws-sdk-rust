    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateExperiment`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder) operation.

                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::set_name): <p>A name for the new experiment.</p>
    ///   - [`description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::description) / [`set_description(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::set_description): <p>An optional description of the experiment.</p>

This randomization ID is a combination of the entity ID and <code>randomizationSalt</code>. If you omit <code>randomizationSalt</code>, Evidently uses the experiment name as the <code>randomizationSalt</code>.</p>

The available audience is the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated to overrides or current launches of this feature.</p>  <p>This is represented in thousandths of a percent. For example, specify 10,000 to allocate 10% of the available audience.</p>

This structure also specifies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.</p>
    ///   - [`segment(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::segment) / [`set_segment(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_experiment::builders::CreateExperimentFluentBuilder::set_segment): <p>Specifies an audience <i>segment</i> to use in the experiment. When a segment is used in an experiment, only user sessions that match the segment pattern are used in the experiment.</p>

You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.</p>  <p>Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.</p>  <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with an experiment.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>
