In this array, include any variations that you want to add or update. If the array includes a variation name that already exists for this feature, it is updated.

If the variation you specify doesn't exist, then this makes no change and does not report an error.</p>  <p>This operation fails if you try to remove a variation that is part of an ongoing launch or experiment.</p>
