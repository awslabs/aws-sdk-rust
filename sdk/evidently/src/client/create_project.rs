If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can view.</p>

Client-side evaluation allows your application to assign variations to user sessions locally instead of by calling the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html">EvaluateFeature</a> operation. This mitigates the latency and availability risks that come with an API call. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-client-side-evaluation.html"> Client-side evaluation - powered by AppConfig.</a> </p>  <p>This parameter is a structure that contains information about the AppConfig application and environment that will be used as for client-side evaluation.</p>  <p>To create a project that uses client-side evaluation, you must have the <code>evidently:ExportProjectAsConfiguration</code> permission.</p>

You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.</p>  <p>Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.</p>  <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with a project.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>
