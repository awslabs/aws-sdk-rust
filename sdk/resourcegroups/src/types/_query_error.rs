/// <p>A two-part error structure that can occur in <code>ListGroupResources</code> or <code>SearchResources</code> operations on CloudFront stack-based queries. The error occurs if the CloudFront stack on which the query is based either does not exist, or has a status that renders the stack inactive. A <code>QueryError</code> occurrence does not necessarily mean that Resource Groups could not complete the operation, but the resulting group might have no member resources.</p>
