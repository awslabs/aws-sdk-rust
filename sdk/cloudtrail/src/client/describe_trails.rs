    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeTrails`](crate::operation::describe_trails::builders::DescribeTrailsFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`trail_name_list(Vec<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_trails::builders::DescribeTrailsFluentBuilder::trail_name_list) / [`set_trail_name_list(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::operation::describe_trails::builders::DescribeTrailsFluentBuilder::set_trail_name_list): <p>Specifies a list of trail names, trail ARNs, or both, of the trails to describe. The format of a trail ARN is:</p>  <p> <code>arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail</code> </p>  <p>If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the current region is returned.</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>If an empty list is specified and <code>IncludeShadowTrails</code> is false, then information for all trails in the current region is returned.</p> </li>   <li> <p>If an empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or true, then information for all trails in the current region and any associated shadow trails in other regions is returned.</p> </li>  </ul> <note>   <p>If one or more trail names are specified, information is returned only if the names match the names of trails belonging only to the current region. To return information about a trail in another region, you must specify its trail ARN.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`include_shadow_trails(bool)`](crate::operation::describe_trails::builders::DescribeTrailsFluentBuilder::include_shadow_trails) / [`set_include_shadow_trails(Option<bool>)`](crate::operation::describe_trails::builders::DescribeTrailsFluentBuilder::set_include_shadow_trails): <p>Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow trail is the replication in a region of a trail that was created in a different region, or in the case of an organization trail, the replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If you do not include shadow trails, organization trails in a member account and region replication trails will not be returned. The default is true.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`DescribeTrailsOutput`](crate::operation::describe_trails::DescribeTrailsOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`trail_list(Option<Vec<Trail>>)`](crate::operation::describe_trails::DescribeTrailsOutput::trail_list): <p>The list of trail objects. Trail objects with string values are only returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration. For example, <code>SNSTopicName</code> and <code>SNSTopicARN</code> are only returned in results if a trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Similarly, <code>KMSKeyId</code> only appears in results if a trail's log files are encrypted with KMS customer managed keys.</p>
