The format of a trail ARN is:</p>  <p> <code>arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail</code> </p>  <p>If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the current region is returned.</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>If an empty list is specified and <code>IncludeShadowTrails</code> is false, then information for all trails in the current region is returned.</p> </li>   <li> <p>If an empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is null or true, then information for all trails in the current region and any associated shadow trails in other regions is returned.</p> </li>  </ul> <note>   <p>If one or more trail names are specified, information is returned only if the names match the names of trails belonging only to the current region.

A shadow trail is the replication in a region of a trail that was created in a different region, or in the case of an organization trail, the replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If you do not include shadow trails, organization trails in a member account and region replication trails will not be returned. The default is true.</p>

Trail objects with string values are only returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration. For example, <code>SNSTopicName</code> and <code>SNSTopicARN</code> are only returned in results if a trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Similarly, <code>KMSKeyId</code> only appears in results if a trail's log files are encrypted with KMS customer managed keys.</p>
