//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//!
//! You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:
//!   - Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases
//!   - Request service quota increases for your account
//!   - Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can chat directly about your support cases
//!
//! For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the following documentation in the _Amazon Web Services Support User Guide_:
//!   - [Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/aws-support-app-for-slack.html)
//!   - [Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/joining-a-live-chat-session.html)
//!   - [Requesting service quota increases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/service-quota-increase.html)
//!   - [Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/support-app-commands.html)
//!
//! You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead of the Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack configurations. For more information, see [Authorize a Slack workspace to enable the Amazon Web Services Support App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/authorize-slack-workspace.html).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-supportapp` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.0.0-smithy-rs-head"
//! aws-sdk-supportapp = "0.41.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_supportapp as supportapp;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), supportapp::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = supportapp::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-supportapp/latest/aws_sdk_supportapp/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
//!

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
