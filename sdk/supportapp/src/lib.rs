//! <fullname>Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack</fullname>
//! <p>You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your support cases in Slack for your
//! Amazon Web Services account. After you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App, you can
//! perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Request service quota increases for your account</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can chat directly about your
//! support cases</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the following
//! documentation in the <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>:</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.


// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
