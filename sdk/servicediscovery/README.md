# aws-sdk-servicediscovery

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

With Cloud Map, you can configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces that your microservice applications run in. When an instance becomes available, you can call the Cloud Map API to register the instance with Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records and an optional health check. Clients that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service receive an answer that contains up to eight healthy records.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-servicediscovery` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.3.0"
aws-sdk-servicediscovery = "0.3.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
