/// When writing a match expression against `EncodingType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let encodingtype = unimplemented!();
/// match encodingtype {
///     EncodingType::Url => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `encodingtype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `EncodingType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `EncodingType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `EncodingType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `encodingtype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `EncodingType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// <p>Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html">object keys</a> in the response. Responses are
/// encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser
/// can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that
/// aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the
/// response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines">Object key
/// naming guidelines</a>.</p>
/// <note>
/// <p>When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will
/// be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object
/// <code>test_file(3).png</code> will appear as <code>test_file%283%29.png</code>.</p>
