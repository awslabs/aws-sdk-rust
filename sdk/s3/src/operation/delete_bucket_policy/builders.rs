/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `DeleteBucketPolicy`.

/// <p>This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation. </p>
/// <p>If you don't have <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions, Amazon S3 returns a <code>403 Access Denied</code> error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a <code>405 Method Not Allowed</code> error. </p> <important>
/// <p>As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.</p>
