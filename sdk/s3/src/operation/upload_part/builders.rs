/// <p>In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> operation.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.</p>
/// <p>Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created.

/// <p>After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts.

Specifically, you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
