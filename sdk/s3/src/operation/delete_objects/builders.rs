/// <p>This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.</p>
/// <p>The request can contain a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.</p><note>

/// <p>The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.</p>
/// <p>When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete.

Specifically, you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
