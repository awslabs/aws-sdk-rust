/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateMultipartUpload`.
/// 
/// <p>This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.</p> 
/// <p>For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>.</p> 
/// <p>If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p> 
/// <p>For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a>.</p> 
/// <p>For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>.</p> <note> 
/// <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p> 
/// <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions">Multipart upload API and permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> 
/// <p>If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.</p>

/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account</p> </li>
