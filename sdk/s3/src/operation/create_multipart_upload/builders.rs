Specifically, you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.

/// <p><b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code> request.</p>

We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your <code>CreateSession</code> requests or <code>PUT</code> object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings.

We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your <code>CreateSession</code> requests or <code>PUT</code> object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting data with server-side encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html">Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads</a>.</p>

You can't override the values of the encryption settings (<code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</code>, and <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled</code>) that are specified in the <code>CreateSession</code> request. You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the <code>CreateSession</code> request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.</p><note>
    /// <p>When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for <code>CreateSession</code>, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the <code>CreateSession</code> request.
