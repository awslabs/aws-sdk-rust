Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p></li>

We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your <code>CreateSession</code> requests or <code>PUT</code> object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings.
