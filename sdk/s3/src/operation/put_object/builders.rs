/// <p>Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.</p> <note>
/// <p>Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use <code>PutObject</code> to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html">Amazon S3 Object Lock</a>.</p>
/// <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>To successfully complete the <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObject</code> in your IAM permissions.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>To successfully change the objects acl of your <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObjectAcl</code> in your IAM permissions.</p> </li>

For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html">Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> </li>

/// <p>You have four mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p>
/// <p>When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. </p>
/// <p>If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the <code>bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a <code>400</code> error with the error code <code>AccessControlListNotSupported</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html"> Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <note>
/// <p>If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. For more information about versioning, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html">Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets</a>. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html">GetBucketVersioning</a>. </p>
