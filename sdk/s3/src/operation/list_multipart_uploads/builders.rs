/// <p><b>Directory buckets</b> - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed.

/// <p>The <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the <code>max-uploads</code> request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> request, the response returns an <code>IsTruncated</code> element with the value of <code>true</code>, a <code>NextKeyMarker</code> element, and a <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: <code>key-marker</code> and <code>upload-id-marker</code>. Set the value of <code>key-marker</code> to the <code>NextKeyMarker</code> value from the previous response. Similarly, set the value of <code>upload-id-marker</code> to the <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> value from the previous response.</p><note>
/// <p><b>Directory buckets</b> - The <code>upload-id-marker</code> element and the <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element aren't supported by directory buckets.

Specifically, you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code> API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
