/// <p>This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a <code>200 OK</code> response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a <code>200 OK</code> response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a <code>404</code> response if the bucket specified in the request does not exist.</p> 
/// <p>This DELETE action requires the <code>S3:DeleteBucketWebsite</code> permission. By default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the <code>S3:DeleteBucketWebsite</code> permission. </p>
