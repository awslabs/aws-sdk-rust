The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form <code> <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.<i>outpostID</i>.s3-outposts.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">Using Amazon S3 on Outposts</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under <code>CommonPrefixes</code> result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.</p>

An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.</p>

You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)</p>

If key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the specified <code>upload-id-marker</code>.</p>

    ///   - [`is_truncated(bool)`](crate::operation::list_multipart_uploads::ListMultipartUploadsOutput::is_truncated): <p>Indicates whether the returned list of multipart uploads is truncated.
