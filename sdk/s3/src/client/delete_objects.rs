    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DeleteObjects`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteObjects) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`bucket(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteObjects::bucket) / [`set_bucket(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteObjects::set_bucket): <p>The bucket name containing the objects to delete. </p>  <p>When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form <code> <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.<i>outpostID</i>.s3-outposts.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">Using Amazon S3 on Outposts</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

    ///   - [`mfa(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteObjects::mfa) / [`set_mfa(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteObjects::set_mfa): <p>The concatenation of the authentication device's serial number, a space, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device.

Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

This header will not provide any additional functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a corresponding <code>x-amz-checksum</code> or <code>x-amz-trailer</code> header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code <code>400 Bad Request</code>.
