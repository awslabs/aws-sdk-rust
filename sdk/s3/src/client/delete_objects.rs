impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DeleteObjects`](crate::operation::delete_objects::builders::DeleteObjectsFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`bucket(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_objects::builders::DeleteObjectsFluentBuilder::bucket) / [`set_bucket(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_objects::builders::DeleteObjectsFluentBuilder::set_bucket):<br>required: **true**<br><p>The bucket name containing the objects to delete.</p> <p><b>Directory buckets</b> - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format <code> <i>Bucket-name</i>.s3express-<i>zone-id</i>.<i>region-code</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format <code> <i>bucket-base-name</i>--<i>zone-id</i>--x-s3</code> (for example, <code> <i>amzn-s3-demo-bucket</i>--<i>usw2-az1</i>--x-s3</code>). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html">Directory bucket naming rules</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p><b>Access points</b> - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p><note>  <p>Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.</p> </note> <p><b>S3 on Outposts</b> - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form <code> <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.<i>outpostID</i>.s3-outposts.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">What is S3 on Outposts?</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p><br>
