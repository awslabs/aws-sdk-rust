The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name.

Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html">Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

This header will not provide any additional functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a corresponding <code>x-amz-checksum</code> or <code>x-amz-trailer</code> header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code <code>400 Bad Request</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html">Checking object integrity</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided <code>ChecksumAlgorithm</code> parameter.</p>
