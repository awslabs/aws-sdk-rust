    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`PutObjectRetention`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutObjectRetention) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`bucket(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutObjectRetention::bucket) / [`set_bucket(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutObjectRetention::set_bucket): <p>The bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this Object Retention configuration to. </p>  <p>When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

    ///   - [`retention(ObjectLockRetention)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutObjectRetention::retention) / [`set_retention(Option<ObjectLockRetention>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PutObjectRetention::set_retention): <p>The container element for the Object Retention configuration.</p>

Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html">Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>

This header will not provide any additional functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a corresponding <code>x-amz-checksum</code> or <code>x-amz-trailer</code> header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code <code>400 Bad Request</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html">Checking object integrity</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided <code>ChecksumAlgorithm</code> parameter.</p>
