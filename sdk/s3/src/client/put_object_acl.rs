The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com.

This header will not provide any additional functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there must be a corresponding <code>x-amz-checksum</code> or <code>x-amz-trailer</code> header sent.
