Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format <code> <i>bucket-base-name</i>--<i>zone-id</i>--x-s3</code> (for example, <code> <i>amzn-s3-demo-bucket</i>--<i>usw2-az1</i>--x-s3</code>).

When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name.

The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form <code> <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.<i>outpostID</i>.s3-outposts.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias.
