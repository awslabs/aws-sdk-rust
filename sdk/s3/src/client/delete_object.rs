impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DeleteObject`](crate::operation::delete_object::builders::DeleteObjectFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`bucket(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_object::builders::DeleteObjectFluentBuilder::bucket) / [`set_bucket(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_object::builders::DeleteObjectFluentBuilder::set_bucket):<br>required: **true**<br><p>The bucket name of the bucket containing the object. </p>  <p> <b>Directory buckets</b> - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format <code> <i>Bucket_name</i>.s3express-<i>az_id</i>.<i>region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format <code> <i>bucket_base_name</i>--<i>az-id</i>--x-s3</code> (for example, <code> <i>DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</i>--<i>usw2-az2</i>--x-s3</code>). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html">Directory bucket naming rules</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p>  <p> <b>Access points</b> - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html">Using access points</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <note>   <p>Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.</p>  </note>  <p> <b>S3 on Outposts</b> - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form <code> <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.<i>outpostID</i>.s3-outposts.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com</code>. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html">What is S3 on Outposts?</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p><br>
