description = "<fullname>AWS Application Discovery Service</fullname>\n\n         <p>AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It\n      automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your\n      on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/\">AWS Application Discovery Service\n        FAQ</a>. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and\n      collecting data about your on-premises servers:</p>\n\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments\n          that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each\n          host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.</p>\n\n               <ul>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating\n              systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure\n              assessment.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only\n              agent-based discovery collects that information.</p>\n                  </li>\n               </ul>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data\n          than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install\n          on one or more hosts in your data center.</p>\n\n               <ul>\n                  <li>\n                     <p> The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an\n              inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization,\n              and network dependencies.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the\n              Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p>\n                  </li>\n               </ul>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>\n                  <b>AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with\n          Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises\n          environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery\n          agent.</p>\n\n               <ul>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery\n              Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the\n              public API.</p>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                     <p>In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can\n              associate applications with servers and track migrations.</p>\n                  </li>\n               </ul>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n\n\n         <p>\n            <b>Recommendations</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and\n      whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based\n      and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial\n      infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect\n      additional information.</p>\n\n         <p>\n            <b>Working With This Guide</b>\n         </p>\n\n         <p>This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the\n      actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the\n      API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to\n      access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using.
