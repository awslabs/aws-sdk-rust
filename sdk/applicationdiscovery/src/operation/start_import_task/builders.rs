/// <p>Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub without having to use the Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent.

/// <li> <p>Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import template, which you can find here: <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv">https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Fill out the template with your server and application data.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Use the console or the <code>StartImportTask</code> command with the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to import the records from your file.</p> </li>
