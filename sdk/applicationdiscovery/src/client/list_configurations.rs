    ///   - [`filters(Vec<Filter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConfigurations::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<Filter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConfigurations::set_filters): <p>You can filter the request using various logical operators and a <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> format. For example: </p>  <p> <code>{"key": "serverType", "value": "webServer"}</code> </p>  <p>For a complete list of filter options and guidance about using them with this action, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-api-queries.html#ListConfigurations">Using the ListConfigurations Action</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide</i>.</p>

For example, if a previous call to ListConfigurations returned 100 items, but you set <code>ListConfigurationsRequest$maxResults</code> to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next set of 10.</p>
