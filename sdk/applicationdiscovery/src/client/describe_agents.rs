impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeAgents`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`agent_ids(Vec<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::agent_ids) / [`set_agent_ids(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_agent_ids): <p>The agent or the Connector IDs for which you want information. If you specify no IDs, the system returns information about all agents/Connectors associated with your Amazon Web Services user account.</p>
    ///   - [`filters(Vec<Filter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<Filter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_filters): <p>You can filter the request using various logical operators and a <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> format. For example: </p>  <p> <code>{"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}</code> </p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::max_results) / [`set_max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_max_results): <p>The total number of agents/Connectors to return in a single page of output. The maximum value is 100.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_next_token): <p>Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you previously specified 100 IDs for <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$agentIds</code> but set <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$maxResults</code> to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next set of 10.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`DescribeAgentsOutput`](crate::output::DescribeAgentsOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`agents_info(Option<Vec<AgentInfo>>)`](crate::output::DescribeAgentsOutput::agents_info): <p>Lists agents or the Connector by ID or lists all agents/Connectors associated with your user account if you did not specify an agent/Connector ID. The output includes agent/Connector IDs, IP addresses, media access control (MAC) addresses, agent/Connector health, host name where the agent/Connector resides, and the version number of each agent/Connector.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeAgentsOutput::next_token): <p>Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you specified 100 IDs for <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$agentIds</code> but set <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$maxResults</code> to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with this token. Use this token in the next query to retrieve the next set of 10.</p>
