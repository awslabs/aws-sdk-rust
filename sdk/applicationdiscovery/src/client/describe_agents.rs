If you specify no IDs, the system returns information about all agents/Connectors associated with your Amazon Web Services user account.</p>
    ///   - [`filters(Vec<Filter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<Filter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_filters): <p>You can filter the request using various logical operators and a <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> format. For example: </p>  <p> <code>{"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}</code> </p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::max_results) / [`set_max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeAgents::set_max_results): <p>The total number of agents/Connectors to return in a single page of output. The maximum value is 100.</p>

For example, if you previously specified 100 IDs for <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$agentIds</code> but set <code>DescribeAgentsRequest$maxResults</code> to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next set of 10.</p>

The output includes agent/Connector IDs, IP addresses, media access control (MAC) addresses, agent/Connector health, host name where the agent/Connector resides, and the version number of each agent/Connector.</p>
