To get the next results, call <code>ListSecrets</code> again with the value from <code>NextToken</code>.</p>

    ///   - [`filters(Vec<Filter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListSecrets::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<Filter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListSecrets::set_filters): <p>The filters to apply to the list of secrets.</p>
    ///   - [`sort_order(SortOrderType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListSecrets::sort_order) / [`set_sort_order(Option<SortOrderType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListSecrets::set_sort_order): <p>Secrets are listed by <code>CreatedDate</code>. </p>
