//! <b>Logging API Requests</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services
//! account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected
//! by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the
//! request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services
//! CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail">Logging
//! Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.
//! To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/secretsmanager).
