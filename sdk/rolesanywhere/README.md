# aws-sdk-rolesanywhere

Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you have for native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web Services resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage long-term credentials for workloads running outside of Amazon Web Services.

To use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509 certificates issued by their certificate authority (CA). You register the CA with IAM Roles Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between your public key infrastructure (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't manage your own PKI system, you can use Private Certificate Authority to create a CA and then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere.

This guide describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you can call programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere, see the [IAM Roles Anywhere User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-rolesanywhere` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-rolesanywhere = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_rolesanywhere as rolesanywhere;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), rolesanywhere::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_rolesanywhere::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-rolesanywhere/latest/aws_sdk_rolesanywhere/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
