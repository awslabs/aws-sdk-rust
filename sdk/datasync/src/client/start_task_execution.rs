These options include how DataSync handles files, objects, and their associated metadata. You also can specify how DataSync verifies data integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other options.</p>  <p>Each task setting has a default value.

The pattern should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to include. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example, <code>"/folder1|/folder2"</code>. </p>
