    ///   - [`options(Options)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateTask::options) / [`set_options(Option<Options>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateTask::set_options): <p>Specifies the configuration options for a task. Some options include preserving file or object metadata and verifying data integrity.</p>  <p>You can also override these options before starting an individual run of a task (also known as a <i>task execution</i>).
