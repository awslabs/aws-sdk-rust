These options include how DataSync handles files, objects, and their associated metadata during your transfer. You also can specify how to verify data integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other options.</p> <p>Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't have to configure any of these options before starting your task.</p>
    ///   - [`excludes(Option<Vec::<FilterRule>>)`](crate::operation::describe_task_execution::DescribeTaskExecutionOutput::excludes): <p>A list of filter rules that exclude specific data during your transfer.

This value is calculated during the task execution's <code>PREPARING</code> phase before the <code>TRANSFERRING</code> phase. The calculation is based on comparing the content of the source and destination locations and finding the difference that needs to be transferred.</p>
    ///   - [`estimated_bytes_to_transfer(i64)`](crate::operation::describe_task_execution::DescribeTaskExecutionOutput::estimated_bytes_to_transfer): <p>The estimated physical number of bytes that will transfer over the network.</p>

This value is updated periodically during the task execution's <code>TRANSFERRING</code> phase when something is read from the source and sent over the network.</p> <p>If DataSync fails to transfer something, this value can be less than <code>EstimatedFilesToTransfer</code>. In some cases, this value can also be greater than <code>EstimatedFilesToTransfer</code>. This element is implementation-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an exact indication of what transferred or to monitor your task execution.</p>

    ///   - [`task_report_config(Option<TaskReportConfig>)`](crate::operation::describe_task_execution::DescribeTaskExecutionOutput::task_report_config): <p>The configuration of your task report, which provides detailed information about for your DataSync transfer.</p>
