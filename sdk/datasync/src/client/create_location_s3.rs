For buckets in Amazon Web Services Regions, the storage class defaults to Standard. For buckets on Outposts, the storage class defaults to Amazon Web Services S3 Outposts.</p>  <p>For more information about S3 storage classes, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">Amazon S3 Storage Classes</a>. Some storage classes have behaviors that can affect your S3 storage cost.
