//! <p>Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization. Alexa for Business provides you with the tools
//! to manage Alexa devices, enroll your users, and assign skills, at scale. You can build your
//! own context-aware voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa for Business API operations.
//! You can also make these available as private skills for your organization. Alexa for Business makes it
//! efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus providing context-aware voice
//! experiences for your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)
//! can create fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business, and manage them
//! as shared devices in their organization. </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
