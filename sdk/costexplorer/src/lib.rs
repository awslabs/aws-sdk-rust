//! <p>You can use the Cost Explorer API to programmatically query your cost and usage data. You
//! can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You can also
//! query for granular data. This might include the number of daily write operations for Amazon
//! DynamoDB database tables in your production environment. </p>
//! <p>Service Endpoint</p>
//! <p>The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>
//! </p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>For information about the costs that are associated with the Cost Explorer API, see
//! <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/">Amazon Web Services Cost
//! Management Pricing</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`].
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
