# aws-sdk-costexplorer

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

You can use the Cost Explorer API to programmatically query your cost and usage data. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You can also query for granular data. This might include the number of daily write operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your production environment.

Service Endpoint

The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:
  - https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

For information about the costs that are associated with the Cost Explorer API, see [Amazon Web Services Cost Management Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-costexplorer` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.23-alpha"
aws-sdk-costexplorer = "0.0.23-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
