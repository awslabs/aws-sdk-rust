__Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration__

You can use Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration APIs to programmatically create, update, delete, get, and list invoice units. You can also programmatically fetch the information of the invoice receiver. For example, business legal name, address, and invoicing contacts.

You can use Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration to receive separate Amazon Web Services invoices based your organizational needs. By using Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration, you can configure invoice units that are groups of Amazon Web Services accounts that represent your business entities, and receive separate invoices for each business entity. You can also assign a unique member or payer account as the invoice receiver for each invoice unit. As you create new accounts within your Organizations using Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration APIs, you can automate the creation of new invoice units and subsequently automate the addition of new accounts to your invoice units.

Service endpoint

You can use the following endpoints for Amazon Web Services Invoice Configuration:
  - https://invoicing.us-east-1.api.aws

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-invoicing` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-invoicing = "1.33.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_invoicing as invoicing;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), invoicing::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_invoicing::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-invoicing/latest/aws_sdk_invoicing/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
