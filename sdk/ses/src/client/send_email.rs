impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`SendEmail`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`source(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::source) / [`set_source(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::set_source): <p>The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a>.</p>  <p>If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the <code>SourceArn</code> parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a>.</p> <note>   <p>Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531">RFC6531</a>. For this reason, the <i>local part</i> of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part">7-bit ASCII characters</a>. If the <i>domain part</i> of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html">RFC3492</a>. The sender name (also known as the <i>friendly name</i>) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047">RFC 2047</a>. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: <code>=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=</code>.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`destination(Destination)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::destination) / [`set_destination(Option<Destination>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::set_destination): <p>The destination for this email, composed of To:, CC:, and BCC: fields.</p>
    ///   - [`message(Message)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::message) / [`set_message(Option<Message>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::SendEmail::set_message): <p>The message to be sent.</p>

If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient's ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the <code>ReturnPath</code> parameter. The <code>ReturnPath</code> parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. </p>

It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the <code>Source</code> parameter.</p>  <p>For example, if the owner of <code>example.com</code> (which has ARN <code>arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com</code>) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from <code>user@example.com</code>, then you would specify the <code>SourceArn</code> to be <code>arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com</code>, and the <code>Source</code> to be <code>user@example.com</code>.</p>  <p>For more information about sending authorization, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a>.</p>
