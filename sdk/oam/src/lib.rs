//! <p>Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links between source accounts and
//! monitoring accounts by using <i>CloudWatch cross-account observability</i>. With
//! CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span
//! multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze your metrics,
//! logs, and traces in any of the linked accounts without account boundaries.</p>
//!
//! <p>Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring
//! accounts</i> and link them with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A
//! monitoring account is a central Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with
//! observability data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside in it.
//! Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring account. The shared
//! observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and traces in X-Ray.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
