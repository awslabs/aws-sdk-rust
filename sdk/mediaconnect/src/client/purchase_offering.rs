You can specify any date and time between 12:00am on the first day of the current month to the current time on today's date, inclusive. Specify the start in a 24-hour notation. Use the following format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SSZ, where T and Z are literal characters. For example, to specify 11:30pm on March 5, 2020, enter 2020-03-05T23:30:00Z.

    ///   - [`reservation(Option<Reservation>)`](crate::output::PurchaseOfferingOutput::reservation): A pricing agreement for a discounted rate for a specific outbound bandwidth that your MediaConnect account will use each month over a specific time period. The discounted rate in the reservation applies to outbound bandwidth for all flows from your account until your account reaches the amount of bandwidth in your reservation. If you use more outbound bandwidth than the agreed upon amount in a single month, the overage is charged at the on-demand rate.
