For example, you submit a ListFlows request with MaxResults set at 5. Although 20 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 5 items. (The service also returns a NextToken value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.) The service might return fewer results than the MaxResults value. If MaxResults is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 10 results per page.<br>

For example, you submit a ListFlows request with MaxResults set at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a NextToken value.
