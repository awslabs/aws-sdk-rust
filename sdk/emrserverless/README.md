# aws-sdk-emrserverless

Amazon EMR Serverless is a new deployment option for Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies running analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With Amazon EMR Serverless, you donâ€™t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run applications with these frameworks.

The API reference to Amazon EMR Serverless is emr-serverless. The emr-serverless prefix is used in the following scenarios:
  - It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, aws emr-serverless start-job-run.
  - It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, "Action": ["emr-serverless:StartJobRun"]. For more information, see [Policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions).
  - It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR Serverless service endpoints. For example, emr-serverless.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-emrserverless` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-emrserverless = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_emrserverless as emrserverless;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), emrserverless::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_emrserverless::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-emrserverless/latest/aws_sdk_emrserverless/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
