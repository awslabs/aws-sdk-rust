    ///   - [`starting_position(Option<EventSourcePosition>)`](crate::operation::delete_event_source_mapping::DeleteEventSourceMappingOutput::starting_position): <p>The position in a stream from which to start reading. Required for Amazon Kinesis, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon MSK stream sources. <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> is supported only for Amazon Kinesis streams.</p>
    ///   - [`starting_position_timestamp(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::delete_event_source_mapping::DeleteEventSourceMappingOutput::starting_position_timestamp): <p>With <code>StartingPosition</code> set to <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code>, the time from which to start reading.</p>
    ///   - [`batch_size(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::delete_event_source_mapping::DeleteEventSourceMappingOutput::batch_size): <p>The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda pulls from your stream or queue and sends to your function. Lambda passes all of the records in the batch to the function in a single call, up to the payload limit for synchronous invocation (6 MB).</p>  <p>Default value: Varies by service. For Amazon SQS, the default is 10. For all other services, the default is 100.</p>  <p>Related setting: When you set <code>BatchSize</code> to a value greater than 10, you must set <code>MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds</code> to at least 1.</p>
    ///   - [`maximum_batching_window_in_seconds(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::delete_event_source_mapping::DeleteEventSourceMappingOutput::maximum_batching_window_in_seconds): <p>The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Lambda spends gathering records before invoking the function. You can configure <code>MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds</code> to any value from 0 seconds to 300 seconds in increments of seconds.</p>  <p>For streams and Amazon SQS event sources, the default batching window is 0 seconds. For Amazon MSK, Self-managed Apache Kafka, and Amazon MQ event sources, the default batching window is 500 ms. Note that because you can only change <code>MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds</code> in increments of seconds, you cannot revert back to the 500 ms default batching window after you have changed it. To restore the default batching window, you must create a new event source mapping.</p>  <p>Related setting: For streams and Amazon SQS event sources, when you set <code>BatchSize</code> to a value greater than 10, you must set <code>MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds</code> to at least 1.</p>

It can be one of the following: <code>Creating</code>, <code>Enabling</code>, <code>Enabled</code>, <code>Disabling</code>, <code>Disabled</code>, <code>Updating</code>, or <code>Deleting</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`state_transition_reason(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_event_source_mapping::DeleteEventSourceMappingOutput::state_transition_reason): <p>Indicates whether a user or Lambda made the last change to the event source mapping.</p>
