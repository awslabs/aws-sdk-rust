//! <p>CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments
//! to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility,
//! serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS
//! service.</p>
//! <p>You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated
//! Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service,
//! code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and
//! so on. CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3
//! buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes
//! to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.</p>
//! <p>CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps
//! you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating
//! your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual
//! deployments.</p>
//! <p>
//! <b>CodeDeploy Components</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeDeploy components:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies
//! the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses this name, which
//! functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision,
//! deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a
//! deployment.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual
//! instances, CodeDeploy
//! Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS
//! service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how
//! to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production
//! traffic to an updated containerized application. An Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All
//! deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback
//! settings.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment
//! rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used
//! when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an
//! Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more
//! instances. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <b>Application revisions</b>: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the
//! Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to
//! validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this
//! is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition,
//! container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises
//! deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code,
//! webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file.
//! Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For
//! Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely
//! identified by its commit ID.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in
//! your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for CodeDeploy
//! deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get
//! details about Amazon ECS service deployments.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
