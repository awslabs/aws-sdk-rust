For example, if <code>ApplicationStop</code> fails, the deployment continues with <code>DownloadBundle</code>. If <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code> fails, the deployment continues with <code>BlockTraffic</code>. If <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> fails, the deployment continues with <code>ApplicationStop</code>. </p>  <p> If false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails during a deployment to an instance, that deployment fails. If deployment to that instance is part of an overall deployment and the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum number of healthy hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is attempted. </p>  <p> During a deployment, the CodeDeploy agent runs the scripts specified for <code>ApplicationStop</code>, <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code>, and <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> in the AppSpec file from the previous successful deployment. (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an error and does not run successfully, the deployment can fail. </p>  <p> If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful deployment that will never run successfully, create a new deployment and use <code>ignoreApplicationStopFailures</code> to specify that the <code>ApplicationStop</code>, <code>BeforeBlockTraffic</code>, and <code>AfterBlockTraffic</code> failures should be ignored. </p>

The alarm configuration that you specify here will override the alarm configuration at the deployment group level. Consider overriding the alarm configuration if you have set up alarms at the deployment group level that are causing deployment failures. In this case, you would call <code>CreateDeployment</code> to create a new deployment that uses a previous application revision that is known to work, and set its alarm configuration to turn off alarm polling. Turning off alarm polling ensures that the new deployment proceeds without being blocked by the alarm that was generated by the previous, failed, deployment.</p> <note>   <p>If you specify an <code>overrideAlarmConfiguration</code>, you need the <code>UpdateDeploymentGroup</code> IAM permission when calling <code>CreateDeployment</code>.</p>  </note>
