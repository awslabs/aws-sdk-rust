# aws-sdk-cloudtraildata

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The CloudTrail Data Service lets you ingest events into CloudTrail from any source in your hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS applications hosted on-premises or in the cloud, virtual machines, or containers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action on this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting tools. After you run PutAuditEvents to ingest your application activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to search, query, and analyze the data that is logged from your applications.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-cloudtraildata` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.57.1"
aws-sdk-cloudtraildata = "0.11.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_cloudtraildata as cloudtraildata;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), cloudtraildata::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_cloudtraildata::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-cloudtraildata/latest/aws_sdk_cloudtraildata/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
