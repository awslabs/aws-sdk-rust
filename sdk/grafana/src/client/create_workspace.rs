    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateWorkspace`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace) operation.
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

If you specify <code>ORGANIZATION</code>, you must specify which organizational units the workspace can access in the <code>workspaceOrganizationalUnits</code> parameter.</p>
    ///   - [`client_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::client_token) / [`set_client_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_client_token): <p>A unique, case-sensitive, user-provided identifier to ensure the idempotency of the request.</p>
    ///   - [`organization_role_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::organization_role_name) / [`set_organization_role_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_organization_role_name): <p>The name of an IAM role that already exists to use with Organizations to access Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels in other accounts in an organization.</p>
    ///   - [`permission_type(PermissionType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::permission_type) / [`set_permission_type(Option<PermissionType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_permission_type): <p>If you specify <code>SERVICE_MANAGED</code> on AWS Grafana console, Amazon Managed Grafana automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels. In the CLI mode, the permissionType <code>SERVICE_MANAGED</code> will not create the IAM role for you. The ability for the Amazon Managed Grafana to create the IAM role on behalf of the user is supported only in the Amazon Managed Grafana AWS console. Use only the <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code> permission type when creating a workspace in the CLI. </p>  <p>If you specify <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>, you will manage those roles and permissions yourself. If you are creating this workspace in a member account of an organization that is not a delegated administrator account, and you want the workspace to access data sources in other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, you must choose <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-manage-permissions.html">Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels</a>.</p>

Specifying these data sources here enables Amazon Managed Grafana to create IAM roles and permissions that allow Amazon Managed Grafana to read data from these sources. You must still add them as data sources in the Grafana console in the workspace.</p>  <p>If you don't specify a data source here, you can still add it as a data source in the workspace console later. However, you will then have to manually configure permissions for it.</p>
    ///   - [`workspace_description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::workspace_description) / [`set_workspace_description(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_workspace_description): <p>A description for the workspace.

    ///   - [`workspace_role_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::workspace_role_arn) / [`set_workspace_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_workspace_role_arn): <p>The workspace needs an IAM role that grants permissions to the Amazon Web Services resources that the workspace will view data from. If you already have a role that you want to use, specify it here. The permission type should be set to <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`authentication_providers(Vec<AuthenticationProviderTypes>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::authentication_providers) / [`set_authentication_providers(Option<Vec<AuthenticationProviderTypes>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateWorkspace::set_authentication_providers): <p>Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity Center (successor to Single Sign-On), or both to authenticate users for using the Grafana console within a workspace.
