//! <p>Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service that you can use to
//! instantly query, correlate, and visualize operational metrics, logs, and traces from multiple sources.
//! Amazon Managed Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana, a widely deployed data visualization tool
//! that is popular for its extensible data support.</p>
//! <p>With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated Grafana servers called <i>workspaces</i>. In
//! a workspace,  you can create  Grafana dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without having to
//! build, package, or deploy any hardware to run Grafana servers.  </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
