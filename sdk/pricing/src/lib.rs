//! <p>Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to
//! programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List
//! uses standardized product attributes such as <code>Location</code>, <code>Storage
//! Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and provides prices at the SKU
//! level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to build cost control and scenario planning tools, reconcile
//! billing data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit
//! analysis that compare your internal workloads with Amazon Web Services.</p>
//! <p>Use <code>GetServices</code> without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then 
//! <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retrieve the attribute names for 
//! that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code>
//! to see what values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, 
//! you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find specific products that you're interested in, such as 
//! an <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a <code>Provisioned IOPS</code> 
//! <code>volumeType</code>.</p>
//! <p>Service Endpoint</p>
//! <p>Amazon Web Services Price List service API provides the following two endpoints:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>https://api.pricing.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
