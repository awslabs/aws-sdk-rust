//! <p>AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.</p>
//! <p>As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an entitlement to through
//! a subscription. You can use the APIs to download or copy your entitled data sets to Amazon
//! Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine
//! learning services.</p>
//! <p>As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would like to publish to a
//! product. Being able to package and provide your data sets into products requires a few
//! steps to determine eligibility. For more information, visit the <i>AWS Data Exchange
//! User Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated over time. Data sets can be
//! updated using revisions, which represent a new version or incremental change to a data set.
//! A revision contains one or more assets. An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data
//! that can be stored as an Amazon S3 object, Redshift datashare, API Gateway API, AWS Lake
//! Formation data permission, or Amazon S3 data access. The asset can be a structured data
//! file, an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import or export
//! operations used to create or copy assets.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
