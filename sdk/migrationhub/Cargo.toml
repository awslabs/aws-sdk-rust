description = "<p>The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application migration status\n         and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by providing a programmatic interface\n         to Migration Hub.</p>\n         <p>Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you call any of\n         these APIs, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error will be returned. Also, you\n         must make the API calls while in your home region.</p>"
