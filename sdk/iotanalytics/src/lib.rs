//! <p>IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them.
//! You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it.  IoT Analytics enables advanced
//! data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration
//! with Amazon QuickSight.</p>
//! <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data
//! often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result
//! the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be
//! cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data
//! from external sources. </p>
//! <p>IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics
//! filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You
//! can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms
//! to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location
//! before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine,
//! or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built models
//! for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to fail or which customers
//! are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.</p>
