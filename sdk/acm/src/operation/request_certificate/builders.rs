/// <p>Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the <code>DomainName</code> parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the <code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code> parameter. </p>
/// <p>If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain.

/// <p>ACM behavior differs from the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2">RFC 6125</a> specification of the certificate validation process. ACM first checks for a Subject Alternative Name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN).</p>
