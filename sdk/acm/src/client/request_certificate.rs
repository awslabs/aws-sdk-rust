Use an asterisk (*) to create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain. For example, *.example.com protects www.example.com, site.example.com, and images.example.com. </p>  <p>In compliance with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280">RFC 5280</a>, the length of the domain name (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot exceed 64 octets (characters), including periods. To add a longer domain name, specify it in the Subject Alternative Name field, which supports names up to 253 octets in length. </p><br>

For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the <code>DomainName</code> field is www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html">Quotas</a>.</p>  <p> The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63 octets. Consider the following examples: </p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)</code> is legal because the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label exceeds 63 octets.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)</code> is not legal because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and the first label exceeds 63 octets.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)</code> is not legal because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds 253 octets.</p> </li>  </ul><br>

Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call <code>RequestCertificate</code> multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one.

However, ECDSA is not supported by all network clients. Some AWS services may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys of a particular size, while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not broken.
