//! <p>This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation provides
//! descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a
//! service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources across Amazon Web Services accounts. If you
//! have multiple Amazon Web Services accounts, you can use RAM to share those resources with other
//! accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you share your resources
//! with your organization or organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you
//! can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles an users. </p>
//! <p>To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
