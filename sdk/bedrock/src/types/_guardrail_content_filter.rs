/// <p>Contains filter strengths for harmful content. Guardrails support the following content filters to detect and filter harmful user inputs and FM-generated outputs.</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p><b>Hate</b> – Describes language or a statement that discriminates, criticizes, insults, denounces, or dehumanizes a person or group on the basis of an identity (such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ability, and national origin).</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><b>Insults</b> – Describes language or a statement that includes demeaning, humiliating, mocking, insulting, or belittling language. This type of language is also labeled as bullying.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><b>Sexual</b> – Describes language or a statement that indicates sexual interest, activity, or arousal using direct or indirect references to body parts, physical traits, or sex.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><b>Violence</b> – Describes language or a statement that includes glorification of or threats to inflict physical pain, hurt, or injury toward a person, group or thing.</p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Content filtering depends on the confidence classification of user inputs and FM responses across each of the four harmful categories. All input and output statements are classified into one of four confidence levels (NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) for each harmful category. For example, if a statement is classified as <i>Hate</i> with HIGH confidence, the likelihood of the statement representing hateful content is high. A single statement can be classified across multiple categories with varying confidence levels. For example, a single statement can be classified as <i>Hate</i> with HIGH confidence, <i>Insults</i> with LOW confidence, <i>Sexual</i> with NONE confidence, and <i>Violence</i> with MEDIUM confidence.</p>
