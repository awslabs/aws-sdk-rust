When this parameter is used, <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> only returns <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code> response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> request with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> returns up to 100 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>

Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the <code>nextToken</code> value. This value is <code>null</code> when there are no more results to return.</p> <note>   <p>Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.</p>  </note>
