    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeComputeEnvironments`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::into_paginator).

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`compute_environments(Vec<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::compute_environments) / [`set_compute_environments(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::set_compute_environments): <p>A list of up to 100 compute environment names or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) entries.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of cluster results returned by <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> in paginated output. When this parameter is used, <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> only returns <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code> response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> request with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> returns up to 100 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_compute_environments::builders::DescribeComputeEnvironmentsFluentBuilder::set_next_token): <p>The <code>nextToken</code> value returned from a previous paginated <code>DescribeComputeEnvironments</code> request where <code>maxResults</code> was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the <code>nextToken</code> value. This value is <code>null</code> when there are no more results to return.</p> <note>   <p>Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.</p>  </note>
