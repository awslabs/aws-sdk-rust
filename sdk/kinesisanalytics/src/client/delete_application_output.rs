Each output configuration that is added to the application, either when the application is created or later using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_AddApplicationOutput.html">AddApplicationOutput</a> operation, has a unique ID. You need to provide the ID to uniquely identify the output configuration that you want to delete from the application configuration. You can use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html">DescribeApplication</a> operation to get the specific <code>OutputId</code>. </p>
