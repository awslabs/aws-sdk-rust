description = "<fullname>AWS Support</fullname>\n        <p>The <i>AWS Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need detailed\n            information about the AWS Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage\n            your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API uses HTTP methods that return\n            results in JSON format.</p>\n        <note>\n            <ul>\n               <li>\n                    <p>You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support\n                        API. </p>\n                </li>\n               <li>\n                    <p>If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a\n                        Business or Enterprise Support plan, the\n                            <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears.

You can\n            retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to\n            refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.</p>\n        <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p> Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels  - The\n                        <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names,\n                    service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels.
