//! <fullname>Amazon Web Services Support</fullname>
//! <p>The <i>Amazon Web Services Support API Reference</i> is intended for programmers who need detailed
//! information about the Amazon Web Services Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage
//! your support cases programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support API uses HTTP methods that return
//! results in JSON format.</p>
//! <note>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support
//! API. </p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a
//! Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the
//! <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error message appears. For
//! information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! </note>
//! <p>You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to access features for <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">Trusted Advisor</a>. You can return a list of
//! checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the
//! refresh status of checks.</p>
//! <p>You can manage your support cases with the following Amazon Web Services Support API operations:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations
//! create Amazon Web Services Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to Amazon Web Services Support
//! cases.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>The <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return Amazon Web Service names, service codes, service categories, and problem
//! severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> operation.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to call the  Trusted Advisor operations. For more
//! information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/">Trusted Advisor</a> in the
//! <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>.</p>
//! <p>For authentication of requests, Amazon Web Services Support uses <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
//! Process</a>.</p>
//! <p>For more information about this service and the endpoints to use, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/about-support-api.html">About the
//! Amazon Web Services Support API</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Support User Guide</i>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.


// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
