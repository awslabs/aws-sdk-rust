/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateStream`.

/// <p>Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or <i>producers</i>. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.</p>
/// <p>You can create your data stream using either on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. Data streams with an on-demand mode require no capacity planning and automatically scale to handle gigabytes of write and read throughput per minute. With the on-demand mode, Kinesis Data Streams automatically manages the shards in order to provide the necessary throughput. For the data streams with a provisioned mode, you must specify the number of shards for the data stream. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.</p>
/// <p>The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the Amazon Web Services account used by the application. It is also scoped by Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.</p>
/// <p> <code>CreateStream</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateStream</code> request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to <code>CREATING</code>. After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>. You should perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> stream. </p>
/// <p>You receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code> when making a <code>CreateStream</code> request when you try to do one of the following:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>Have more than five streams in the <code>CREATING</code> state at any point in time.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Create more shards than are authorized for your account.</p> </li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>For the default shard limit for an Amazon Web Services account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. To increase this limit, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html">contact Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p>
