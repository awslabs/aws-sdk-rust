/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutRecords`.
/// 
/// <p>Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to as a <code>PutRecords</code> request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing. </p> <note> 
/// <p>When invoking this API, it is recommended you use the <code>StreamARN</code> input parameter rather than the <code>StreamName</code> input parameter.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>Each <code>PutRecords</code> request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.</p> 
/// <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.</p> 
/// <p>The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p> 
/// <p>The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> 
/// <p>Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter, <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> 
/// <p>The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response <code>Records</code>. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records as the request array.</p> 
/// <p>The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use <code>PutRecord</code> instead of <code>PutRecords</code>, and write to the same shard.</p> 
/// <p>A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code> parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.</p> 
/// <p>An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <important> 
/// <p>After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.</p> 
/// </important> 
/// <p>By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use <code>IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</code> or <code>DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</code> to modify this retention period.</p>
