    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`PutRecord`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder) operation.
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`stream_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::stream_name) / [`set_stream_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_stream_name): <p>The name of the stream to put the data record into.</p>
    ///   - [`data(Blob)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::data) / [`set_data(Option<Blob>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_data): <p>The data blob to put into the record, which is base64-encoded when the blob is serialized. When the data blob (the payload before base64-encoding) is added to the partition key size, the total size must not exceed the maximum record size (1 MiB).</p>
    ///   - [`partition_key(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::partition_key) / [`set_partition_key(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_partition_key): <p>Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream.</p>
    ///   - [`explicit_hash_key(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::explicit_hash_key) / [`set_explicit_hash_key(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_explicit_hash_key): <p>The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash.</p>
    ///   - [`sequence_number_for_ordering(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::sequence_number_for_ordering) / [`set_sequence_number_for_ordering(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_sequence_number_for_ordering): <p>Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same partition key. Usage: set the <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> of record <i>n</i> to the sequence number of record <i>n-1</i> (as returned in the result when putting record <i>n-1</i>). If this parameter is not set, records are coarsely ordered based on arrival time.</p>
    ///   - [`stream_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::stream_arn) / [`set_stream_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::builders::PutRecordFluentBuilder::set_stream_arn): <p>The ARN of the stream.</p>

    ///   - [`shard_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::PutRecordOutput::shard_id): <p>The shard ID of the shard where the data record was placed.</p>
    ///   - [`sequence_number(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::put_record::PutRecordOutput::sequence_number): <p>The sequence number identifier that was assigned to the put data record. The sequence number for the record is unique across all records in the stream. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record put into the stream.</p>
    ///   - [`encryption_type(Option<EncryptionType>)`](crate::operation::put_record::PutRecordOutput::encryption_type): <p>The encryption type to use on the record. This parameter can be one of the following values:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>NONE</code>: Do not encrypt the records in the stream.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>KMS</code>: Use server-side encryption on the records in the stream using a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key.</p> </li>  </ul>
