# aws-sdk-amplifyuibuilder

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and themes for use in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to an application's backend Amazon Web Services resources.

You can also use the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components and model data for an app. For more information, see [Introduction](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro) in the _Amplify Docs_.

The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation for client app development. For more information, see the [Amplify Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/). For more information about deploying an Amplify application to Amazon Web Services, see the [Amplify User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-amplifyuibuilder` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.57.1"
aws-sdk-amplifyuibuilder = "0.35.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_amplifyuibuilder as amplifyuibuilder;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), amplifyuibuilder::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_amplifyuibuilder::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-amplifyuibuilder/latest/aws_sdk_amplifyuibuilder/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
