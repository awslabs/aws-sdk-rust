    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`MergePullRequestBySquash`](crate::operation::merge_pull_request_by_squash::builders::MergePullRequestBySquashFluentBuilder) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

To get this ID, use <code>ListPullRequests</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`repository_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::merge_pull_request_by_squash::builders::MergePullRequestBySquashFluentBuilder::repository_name) / [`set_repository_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::merge_pull_request_by_squash::builders::MergePullRequestBySquashFluentBuilder::set_repository_name): <p>The name of the repository where the pull request was created.</p>

Pass this value if you want an exception thrown if the current commit ID of the tip of the source branch does not match this commit ID.</p>

If unspecified, the default FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches has differences on the same line.</p>

The default is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the merge operation is successful.</p>

This information is used as both the author and committer for the commit.</p>
    ///   - [`email(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::merge_pull_request_by_squash::builders::MergePullRequestBySquashFluentBuilder::email) / [`set_email(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::merge_pull_request_by_squash::builders::MergePullRequestBySquashFluentBuilder::set_email): <p>The email address of the person merging the branches.

If true, a .gitkeep file is created for empty folders. The default is false.</p>
