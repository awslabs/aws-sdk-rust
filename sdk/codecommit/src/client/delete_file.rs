For example, /examples/file.md is a fully qualified path to a file named file.md in a folder named examples.</p>

This must be the HEAD commit for the branch. The commit that deletes the file is created from this commit ID.</p>

By default, empty folders are deleted. This includes empty folders that are part of the directory structure. For example, if the path to a file is dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4, and dir2 and dir3 are empty, deleting the last file in dir4 also deletes the empty folders dir4, dir3, and dir2.</p>
