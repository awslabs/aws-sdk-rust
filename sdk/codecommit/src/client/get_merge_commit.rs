    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`GetMergeCommit`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`repository_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::repository_name) / [`set_repository_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::set_repository_name): <p>The name of the repository that contains the merge commit about which you want to get information.</p>
    ///   - [`source_commit_specifier(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::source_commit_specifier) / [`set_source_commit_specifier(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::set_source_commit_specifier): <p>The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).</p>
    ///   - [`destination_commit_specifier(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::destination_commit_specifier) / [`set_destination_commit_specifier(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::set_destination_commit_specifier): <p>The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).</p>

If unspecified, the default FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a conflict is considered not mergeable if the same file in both branches has differences on the same line.</p>
    ///   - [`conflict_resolution_strategy(ConflictResolutionStrategyTypeEnum)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::conflict_resolution_strategy) / [`set_conflict_resolution_strategy(Option<ConflictResolutionStrategyTypeEnum>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetMergeCommit::set_conflict_resolution_strategy): <p>Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before the merge operation is successful.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`GetMergeCommitOutput`](crate::output::GetMergeCommitOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`source_commit_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::GetMergeCommitOutput::source_commit_id): <p>The commit ID of the source commit specifier that was used in the merge evaluation.</p>

    ///   - [`merged_commit_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::GetMergeCommitOutput::merged_commit_id): <p>The commit ID for the merge commit created when the source branch was merged into the destination branch. If the fast-forward merge strategy was used, there is no merge commit.</p>
