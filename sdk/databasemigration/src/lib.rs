//! <fullname>Database Migration Service</fullname>
//! <p>Database Migration Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the most
//! widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL
//! Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise
//! (ASE). The service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as
//! heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or
//! SQL Server to PostgreSQL.</p>
//! <p>For more information about DMS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">What Is Database Migration Service?</a>
//! in the <i>Database Migration Service User Guide.</i>
//! </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
