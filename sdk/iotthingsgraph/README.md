# aws-sdk-iotthingsgraph

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

AWS IoT Things Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable developers to connect devices and services that use different standards, such as units of measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible to build IoT applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services and defining how they interact at an abstract level.

For more information about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/thingsgraph/latest/ug/iot-tg-whatis.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are availble for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-iotthingsgraph` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.21-alpha"
aws-sdk-iotthingsgraph = "0.0.21-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
