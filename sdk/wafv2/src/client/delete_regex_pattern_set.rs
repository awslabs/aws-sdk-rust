    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DeleteRegexPatternSet`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet) operation.
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::set_name): <p>The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the set.</p>
    ///   - [`scope(Scope)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::scope) / [`set_scope(Option<Scope>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::set_scope): <p>Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool. </p>  <p>To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows: </p>  <ul>   <li> <p>CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: <code>--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1</code>. </p> </li>   <li> <p>API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1. </p> </li>  </ul>
    ///   - [`id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::id) / [`set_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::set_id): <p>A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.</p>
    ///   - [`lock_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::lock_token) / [`set_lock_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteRegexPatternSet::set_lock_token): <p>A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your <code>get</code> and <code>list</code> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like <code>update</code> and <code>delete</code>. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a <code>WAFOptimisticLockException</code>. If this happens, perform another <code>get</code>, and use the new token returned by that operation. </p>
