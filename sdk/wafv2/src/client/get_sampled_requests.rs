    ///   - [`rule_metric_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_sampled_requests::builders::GetSampledRequestsFluentBuilder::rule_metric_name) / [`set_rule_metric_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_sampled_requests::builders::GetSampledRequestsFluentBuilder::set_rule_metric_name): <p>The metric name assigned to the <code>Rule</code> or <code>RuleGroup</code> dimension for which you want a sample of requests.</p>

A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool. </p>  <p>To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows: </p>  <ul>   <li> <p>CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: <code>--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1</code>. </p> </li>   <li> <p>API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1. </p> </li>  </ul>

You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, <code>Z</code>. For example, <code>"2016-09-27T14:50Z"</code>. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours. If you specify a start time that's earlier than three hours ago, WAF sets it to three hours ago.</p>

If your resource received fewer requests than the value of <code>MaxItems</code>, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns information about all of them. </p>

    ///   - [`time_window(Option<TimeWindow>)`](crate::operation::get_sampled_requests::GetSampledRequestsOutput::time_window): <p>Usually, <code>TimeWindow</code> is the time range that you specified in the <code>GetSampledRequests</code> request. However, if your Amazon Web Services resource received more than 5,000 requests during the time range that you specified in the request, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns the time range for the first 5,000 requests. Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.</p>
