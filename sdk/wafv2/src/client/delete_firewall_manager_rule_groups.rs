WAF returns a token to your <code>get</code> and <code>list</code> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request.

WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a <code>WAFOptimisticLockException</code>. If this happens, perform another <code>get</code>, and use the new token returned by that operation. </p>
