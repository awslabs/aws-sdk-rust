/// <p>Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose action you want to change. </p> 
/// <p>You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of rule actions to <code>Count</code> and then monitor the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule group manages your web traffic.</p>
