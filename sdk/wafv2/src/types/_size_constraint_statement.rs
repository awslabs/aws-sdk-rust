/// <p>A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (&gt;) or less than (&lt;). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.</p>
/// <p>If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes of the body up to the limit for the web ACL. By default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs, this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront web ACLs, you can increase the limit in the web ACL <code>AssociationConfig</code>, for additional fees. If you know that the request body for your web requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you could use a size constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body size.</p>
/// <p>If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI <code>/logo.jpg</code> is nine characters long.</p>
