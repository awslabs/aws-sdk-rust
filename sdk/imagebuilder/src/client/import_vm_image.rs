This version follows the semantic version syntax.</p> <note>   <p>The semantic version has four nodes: <major>    .    <minor>     .     <patch>      /      <build>       . You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.      </build>     </patch>    </minor>   </major></p>   <p> <b>Assignment:</b> For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.</p>   <p> <b>Patterns:</b> You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.</p>  </note>
