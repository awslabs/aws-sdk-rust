You are given a single capacity unit by default. If you want to use the default capacity, you don't set additional capacity units.

You can also use tags to help control access to the rescore execution plan. Tag keys and values can consist of Unicode letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = + - @.</p>

Multiple calls to the <code>CreateRescoreExecutionPlanRequest</code> API with the same client token will create only one rescore execution plan.</p>
