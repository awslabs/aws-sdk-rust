description = "<fullname>CodeBuild</fullname>\n        <p>CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code,\n            runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the\n            need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged\n            build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as\n            Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild\n            to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You\n            pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about CodeBuild, see the <i>\n                <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">CodeBuild User\n                    Guide</a>.</i>\n         </p>"
