/// <p>Changes the public visibility for a project. The project's build results, logs, and artifacts are available to the general public.

/// <p>The following should be kept in mind when making your projects public:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>All of a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including builds that were run when the project was private, are available to the general public.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>All build logs and artifacts are available to the public. Environment variables, source code, and other sensitive information may have been output to the build logs and artifacts. You must be careful about what information is output to the build logs. Some best practice are:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>Do not store sensitive values, especially Amazon Web Services access key IDs and secret access keys, in environment variables. We recommend that you use an Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to store sensitive values.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>Follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/webhooks.html#webhook-best-practices">Best practices for using webhooks</a> in the <i>CodeBuild User Guide</i> to limit which entities can trigger a build, and do not store the buildspec in the project itself, to ensure that your webhooks are as secure as possible.</p> </li>
/// </ul> </li>
/// <li> <p>A malicious user can use public builds to distribute malicious artifacts. We recommend that you review all pull requests to verify that the pull request is a legitimate change. We also recommend that you validate any artifacts with their checksums to make sure that the correct artifacts are being downloaded.</p> </li>
