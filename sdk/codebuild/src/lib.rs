//! <fullname>CodeBuild</fullname>
//! <p>CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code,
//! runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the
//! need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged
//! build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as
//! Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild
//! to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You
//! pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about CodeBuild, see the <i>
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodeBuild User
//! Guide</a>.</i>
//! </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
