## Getting Started

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-codestarnotifications` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.7.0"
aws-sdk-codestarnotifications = "0.7.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK
