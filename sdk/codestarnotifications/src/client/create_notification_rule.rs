    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::set_name): <p>The name for the notification rule. Notification rule names must be unique in your Amazon Web Services account.</p>

For a list of allowed events, see <code>EventTypeSummary</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`resource(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::resource) / [`set_resource(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::set_resource): <p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to associate with the notification rule. Supported resources include pipelines in CodePipeline, repositories in CodeCommit, and build projects in CodeBuild.</p>
    ///   - [`targets(Vec<Target>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::targets) / [`set_targets(Option<Vec<Target>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::set_targets): <p>A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Service topics and Chatbot clients to associate with the notification rule.</p>

    ///   - [`client_request_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::client_request_token) / [`set_client_request_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateNotificationRule::set_client_request_token): <p>A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided in a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed parameter. If a request with the same parameters is received and a token is included, the request returns information about the initial request that used that token.</p> <note>   <p>The Amazon Web Services SDKs prepopulate client request tokens. If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK, an idempotency token is created for you.</p>  </note>

The default value is <code>ENABLED</code>. If the status is set to <code>DISABLED</code>, notifications aren't sent for the notification rule.</p>
