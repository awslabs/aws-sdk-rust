# aws-sdk-applicationsignals

Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your cloud-based applications. It enables real-time service health dashboards and helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals. The application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across your applications, services, and dependencies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any issues that may arise, ensuring optimal customer experience.

Application Signals provides the following benefits:
  - Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults, and errors.
  - Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).
  - See a map of your application topology that Application Signals automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.

Application Signals works with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics canaries, and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to display your client pages, Synthetics canaries, and application names within dashboards and maps.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-applicationsignals` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-applicationsignals = "1.14.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_applicationsignals as applicationsignals;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), applicationsignals::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_applicationsignals::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-applicationsignals/latest/aws_sdk_applicationsignals/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
