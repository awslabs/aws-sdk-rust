/// <p>For invited accounts, <code>CreateMembers</code> sends a request to invite the specified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph. </p>
/// <p> <code>CreateMembers</code> verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally.</p>

/// <p>The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite or to enable.</p>

/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>The accounts that <code>CreateMembers</code> was able to process. For invited accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification.
