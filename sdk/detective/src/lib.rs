//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//!
//! Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
//!
//! The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.
//!
//! To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.
//!
//! Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.
//!
//! The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.
//!
//! Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.
//!
//! The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:
//!   - Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.
//!   - View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
//!   - Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
//!   - Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
//!   - Apply tags to a behavior graph.
//!
//! The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for Detective.
//!
//! The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:
//!   - Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
//!   - Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.
//!
//! An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
//!   - View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
//!   - Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
//!   - Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
//!   - Remove their account from a behavior graph.
//!
//! All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See [Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-detective` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.55.0"
//! aws-sdk-detective = "0.25.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_detective as detective;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), detective::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = detective::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-detective/latest/aws_sdk_detective/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by Amazon Detective. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling Amazon Detective.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_detective::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_detective::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`AcceptInvitation`](crate::operation::accept_invitation) operation has
/// a [`Client::accept_invitation`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `call()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.accept_invitation()
///     .graph_arn("example")
///     .call()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
