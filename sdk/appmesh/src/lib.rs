//! <p>App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to
//! monitor and control microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices
//! communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for
//! your applications.</p>
//! <p>App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for
//! every microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and
//! Amazon EC2.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery
//! naming for their components. For more information about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service
//! Discovery</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes
//! <code>kube-dns</code> and <code>coredns</code> are supported. For more information,
//! see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/">DNS
//! for Services and Pods</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>
//! </note>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
