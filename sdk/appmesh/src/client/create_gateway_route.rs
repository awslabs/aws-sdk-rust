    ///   - [`mesh_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateGatewayRoute::mesh_name) / [`set_mesh_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateGatewayRoute::set_mesh_name): <p>The name of the service mesh to create the gateway route in.</p>

If the virtual gateway is in a shared mesh, then you must be the owner of the virtual gateway resource.</p>
    ///   - [`spec(GatewayRouteSpec)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateGatewayRoute::spec) / [`set_spec(Option<GatewayRouteSpec>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateGatewayRoute::set_spec): <p>The gateway route specification to apply.</p>

Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.</p>

Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.</p>

If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html">Working with shared meshes</a>.</p>
