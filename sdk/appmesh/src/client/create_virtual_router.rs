Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.</p>

If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh.
