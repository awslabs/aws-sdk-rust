                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

Amazon MQ passes your ID with the API action. Note: We recommend using a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the creatorRequestId. You may omit the creatorRequestId if your application doesn't require idempotency.</p>

Set to false by default, if no value is provided.</p>
    ///   - [`security_groups(Vec<String>)`](crate::operation::create_broker::builders::CreateBrokerFluentBuilder::security_groups) / [`set_security_groups(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::operation::create_broker::builders::CreateBrokerFluentBuilder::set_security_groups): <p>The list of rules (1 minimum, 125 maximum) that authorize connections to brokers.</p>

If you specify more than one subnet, the subnets must be in different Availability Zones. Amazon MQ will not be able to create VPC endpoints for your broker with multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone. A SINGLE_INSTANCE deployment requires one subnet (for example, the default subnet). An ACTIVE_STANDBY_MULTI_AZ Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ deployment requires two subnets. A CLUSTER_MULTI_AZ Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ deployment has no subnet requirements when deployed with public accessibility. Deployment without public accessibility requires at least one subnet.</p> <important>  <p>If you specify subnets in a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html">shared VPC</a> for a RabbitMQ broker, the associated VPC to which the specified subnets belong must be owned by your AWS account. Amazon MQ will not be able to create VPC endpoints in VPCs that are not owned by your AWS account.</p> </important>

The list of broker users (persons or applications) who can access queues and topics. This value can contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, periods, underscores, and tildes (- . _ ~). This value must be 2-100 characters long.</p> <important>  <title>Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ</title>   <p>When you create an Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ broker, one and only one administrative user is accepted and created when a broker is first provisioned. All subsequent broker users are created by making RabbitMQ API calls directly to brokers or via the RabbitMQ web console.</p> </important>
