//! <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname>
//! <p>You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can
//! create and manage <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts
//! that monitor your endpoints and APIs
//! from the outside-in. You can set up your canaries to run
//! 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and latency
//! of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data,
//! screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch
//! ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more
//! information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using ServiceLens to Monitor
//! the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User
//! Guide</i>.</p>
//!
//! <p>Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations. For more
//! information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html">Security
//! Considerations for Synthetics Canaries</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
