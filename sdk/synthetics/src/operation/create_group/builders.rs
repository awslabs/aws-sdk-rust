/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateGroup`.
///
/// <p>Creates a group which you can use to associate canaries with each other, including cross-Region canaries. Using groups can help you with managing and automating your canaries, and you can also view aggregated run results and statistics for all canaries in a group.</p>
/// <p>Groups are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions, and you can view it and add canaries to it from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region name where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region. This means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries in a single view.</p>
/// <p>Groups are supported in all Regions except the Regions that are disabled by default. For more information about these Regions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable">Enabling a Region</a>.</p>
/// <p>Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries. You can have as many as 20 groups in your account. Any single canary can be a member of up to 10 groups.</p>
