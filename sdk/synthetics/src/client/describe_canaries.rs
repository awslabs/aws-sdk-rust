impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeCanaries`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::set_next_token): <p>A token that indicates that there is more data available. You can use this token in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::set_max_results): <p>Specify this parameter to limit how many canaries are returned each time you use the <code>DescribeCanaries</code> operation. If you omit this parameter, the default of 100 is used.</p>
    ///   - [`names(Vec<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::names) / [`set_names(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeCanaries::set_names): <p>Use this parameter to return only canaries that match the names that you specify here. You can specify as many as five canary names.</p>  <p>If you specify this parameter, the operation is successful only if you have authorization to view all the canaries that you specify in your request. If you do not have permission to view any of the canaries, the request fails with a 403 response.</p>  <p>You are required to use this parameter if you are logged on to a user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which canaries that you are allowed to view. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Restricted.html"> Limiting a user to viewing specific canaries</a>.</p>
