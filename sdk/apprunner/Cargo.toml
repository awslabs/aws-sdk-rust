description = "<fullname>AWS App Runner</fullname>\n\n      \n\n         <p>AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code\n      to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to\n      provision and configure AWS resources.</p>\n         <p>App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations,\n      high performance, scalability, and security.</p>\n         <p>For more information about App Runner, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/\">AWS App Runner Developer Guide</a>.\n      For release information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/\">AWS App Runner Release Notes</a>.</p>\n         <p>\n       To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated\n      Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for\n        Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>\n         <p>\n            <b>Endpoints</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html\">AWS App Runner\n        endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p>"
