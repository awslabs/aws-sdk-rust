However, you can't switch from code to image or the other way around. This means that you must provide the same structure member of <code>SourceConfiguration</code> that you originally included when you created the service. Specifically, you can include either <code>CodeRepository</code> or <code>ImageRepository</code>. To update the source configuration, set the values to members of the structure that you include.</p>

    ///   - [`health_check_configuration(HealthCheckConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateService::health_check_configuration) / [`set_health_check_configuration(Option<HealthCheckConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateService::set_health_check_configuration): <p>The settings for the health check that App Runner performs to monitor the health of the App Runner service.</p>
    ///   - [`network_configuration(NetworkConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateService::network_configuration) / [`set_network_configuration(Option<NetworkConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::UpdateService::set_network_configuration): <p>Configuration settings related to network traffic of the web application that the App Runner service runs.</p>
