It must be unique across all the running App Runner services in your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region.</p>
    ///   - [`source_configuration(SourceConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::source_configuration) / [`set_source_configuration(Option<SourceConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::set_source_configuration): <p>The source to deploy to the App Runner service. It can be a code or an image repository.</p>

A tag is a key-value pair.</p>
    ///   - [`encryption_configuration(EncryptionConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::encryption_configuration) / [`set_encryption_configuration(Option<EncryptionConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::set_encryption_configuration): <p>An optional custom encryption key that App Runner uses to encrypt the copy of your source repository that it maintains and your service logs. By default, App Runner uses an Amazon Web Services managed key.</p>
    ///   - [`health_check_configuration(HealthCheckConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::health_check_configuration) / [`set_health_check_configuration(Option<HealthCheckConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::set_health_check_configuration): <p>The settings for the health check that App Runner performs to monitor the health of the App Runner service.</p>

If not provided, App Runner associates the latest revision of a default auto scaling configuration.</p>  <p>Specify an ARN with a name and a revision number to associate that revision. For example: <code>arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/3</code> </p>  <p>Specify just the name to associate the latest revision. For example: <code>arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability</code> </p>

    ///   - [`observability_configuration(ServiceObservabilityConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::observability_configuration) / [`set_observability_configuration(Option<ServiceObservabilityConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateService::set_observability_configuration): <p>The observability configuration of your service.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`CreateServiceOutput`](crate::output::CreateServiceOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`service(Option<Service>)`](crate::output::CreateServiceOutput::service): <p>A description of the App Runner service that's created by this request.</p>
