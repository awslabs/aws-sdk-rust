//! <fullname>App Runner</fullname>
//!
//!
//!
//! <p>App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code
//! to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to
//! provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources.</p>
//! <p>App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations,
//! high performance, scalability, and security.</p>
//! <p>For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">App Runner Developer Guide</a>.
//! For release information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/">App Runner Release Notes</a>.</p>
//! <p>
//! To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated
//! Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for
//! Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
//! <p>
//! <b>Endpoints</b>
//! </p>
//! <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html">App Runner
//! endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
