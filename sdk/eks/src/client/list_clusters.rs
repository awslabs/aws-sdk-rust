    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`ListClusters`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::into_paginator).
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of cluster results returned by <code>ListClusters</code> in paginated output. When you use this parameter, <code>ListClusters</code> returns only <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code> response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another <code>ListClusters</code> request with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, <code>ListClusters</code> returns up to 100 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::set_next_token): <p>The <code>nextToken</code> value returned from a previous paginated <code>ListClusters</code> request where <code>maxResults</code> was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the <code>nextToken</code> value.</p> <note>   <p>This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`include(Vec<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::include) / [`set_include(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::set_include): <p>Indicates whether external clusters are included in the returned list. Use '<code>all</code>' to return connected clusters, or blank to return only Amazon EKS clusters. '<code>all</code>' must be in lowercase otherwise an error occurs.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`ListClustersOutput`](crate::output::ListClustersOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`clusters(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::output::ListClustersOutput::clusters): <p>A list of all of the clusters for your account in the specified Region.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::ListClustersOutput::next_token): <p>The <code>nextToken</code> value to include in a future <code>ListClusters</code> request. When the results of a <code>ListClusters</code> request exceed <code>maxResults</code>, you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results. This value is <code>null</code> when there are no more results to return.</p>
