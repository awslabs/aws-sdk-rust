When you use this parameter, <code>ListClusters</code> returns only <code>maxResults</code> results in a single page along with a <code>nextToken</code> response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another <code>ListClusters</code> request with the returned <code>nextToken</code> value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, <code>ListClusters</code> returns up to 100 results and a <code>nextToken</code> value if applicable.</p>

Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the <code>nextToken</code> value.</p> <note>   <p>This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`include(Vec<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::include) / [`set_include(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListClusters::set_include): <p>Indicates whether external clusters are included in the returned list. Use '<code>all</code>' to return connected clusters, or blank to return only Amazon EKS clusters. '<code>all</code>' must be in lowercase otherwise an error occurs.</p>

This value is <code>null</code> when there are no more results to return.</p>
