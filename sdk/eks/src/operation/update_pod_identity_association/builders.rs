/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `UpdatePodIdentityAssociation`.
///
/// <p>Updates a EKS Pod Identity association. In an update, you can change the IAM role, the target IAM role, or <code>disableSessionTags</code>. You must change at least one of these in an update. An association can't be moved between clusters, namespaces, or service accounts. If you need to edit the namespace or service account, you need to delete the association and then create a new association with your desired settings.</p>
/// <p>Similar to Amazon Web Services IAM behavior, EKS Pod Identity associations are eventually consistent, and may take several seconds to be effective after the initial API call returns successfully. You must design your applications to account for these potential delays. We recommend that you don’t include association create/updates in the critical, high-availability code paths of your application. Instead, make changes in a separate initialization or setup routine that you run less frequently.</p>
/// <p>You can set a <i>target IAM role</i> in the same or a different account for advanced scenarios. With a target role, EKS Pod Identity automatically performs two role assumptions in sequence: first assuming the role in the association that is in this account, then using those credentials to assume the target IAM role. This process provides your Pod with temporary credentials that have the permissions defined in the target role, allowing secure access to resources in another Amazon Web Services account.</p>
