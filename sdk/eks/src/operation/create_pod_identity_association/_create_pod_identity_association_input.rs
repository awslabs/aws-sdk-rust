By default, EKS Pod Identity attaches six tags, including tags for cluster name, namespace, and service account name. For the list of tags added by EKS Pod Identity, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-abac.html#pod-id-abac-tags">List of session tags added by EKS Pod Identity</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>.</p>
    /// <p>Amazon Web Services compresses inline session policies, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. If you receive a <code>PackedPolicyTooLarge</code> error indicating the packed binary format has exceeded the size limit, you can attempt to reduce the size by disabling the session tags added by EKS Pod Identity.</p>

    /// <p>When you run applications on Amazon EKS, your application might need to access Amazon Web Services resources from a different role that exists in the same or different Amazon Web Services account. For example, your application running in “Account A” might need to access resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets in “Account B” or within “Account A” itself. You can create a association to access Amazon Web Services resources in “Account B” by creating two IAM roles: a role in “Account A” and a role in “Account B” (which can be the same or different account), each with the necessary trust and permission policies. After you provide these roles in the <i>IAM role</i> and <i>Target IAM role</i> fields, EKS will perform role chaining to ensure your application gets the required permissions. This means Role A will assume Role B, allowing your Pods to securely access resources like S3 buckets in the target account.</p>
