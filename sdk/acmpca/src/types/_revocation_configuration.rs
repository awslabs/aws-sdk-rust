/// <p>Certificate revocation information used by the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html">CreateCertificateAuthority</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html">UpdateCertificateAuthority</a> actions. Your private certificate authority (CA) can configure Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support and/or maintain a certificate revocation list (CRL). OCSP returns validation information about certificates as requested by clients, and a CRL contains an updated list of certificates revoked by your CA. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeCertificate.html">RevokeCertificate</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/revocation-setup.html">Setting up a certificate revocation method</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority User Guide</i>.</p>
