Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html">Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA</a>.</p></li>

/// <li>
/// <p>For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy.
