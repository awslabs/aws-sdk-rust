description = "<p>This is the <i>ACM Private CA API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions,\n\t\t\tsyntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating\n\t\t\tand managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization.</p>\n\t\t       <p>The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML\n\t\t\tresponse. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's\n\t\t\ttailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more\n\t\t\tinformation, see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">AWS\n\t\t\tSDKs</a>.</p>\n\t\t       <p>Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation\n\t\t\tcan be called per second. ACM Private CA throttles API requests at different rates depending\n\t\t\ton the operation. Throttling means that ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request\n\t\t\tbecause the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second.\n\t\t\tWhen a request is throttled, ACM Private CA returns a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html\">ThrottlingException</a> error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request\n\t\t\trate for APIs. </p>\n\n\t\t       <p>To see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase,\n\t\t\tlog into your AWS account and visit the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/\">Service Quotas</a>\n\t\t\tconsole.</p>"
