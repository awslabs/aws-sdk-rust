description = "<p>This is the <i>ACM Private CA API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions,\n\t\t\tsyntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating\n\t\t\tand managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization.</p>\n\t\t       <p>The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML\n\t\t\tresponse. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's\n\t\t\ttailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more\n\t\t\tinformation, see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">AWS\n\t\t\tSDKs</a>.</p>\n\t\t       <note>\n\t\t\t         <p>Each ACM Private CA API action has a quota that determines the number of times the action\n\t\t\t\tcan be called per second. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaLimits.html#PcaLimits-api\">API Rate Quotas in ACM Private CA</a>\n\t\t\t\tin the ACM Private CA user guide.</p>\n\t\t       </note>"
