/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutSubscriptionFilter`.
///
/// <p>Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. With subscription filters, you can subscribe to a real-time stream of log events ingested through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html">PutLogEvents</a> and have them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.</p>
/// <p>The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li> <p>An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>An Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>An Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.</p> </li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>Each log group can have up to two subscription filters associated with it. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in <code>filterName</code>. </p>
/// <p>To perform a <code>PutSubscriptionFilter</code> operation, you must also have the <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission.</p>
