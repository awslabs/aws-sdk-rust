If the response to this API call is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a pagination token in the response. To fetch next page of slot types, specify the pagination token in the next request.</p>

A slot type will be returned if any part of its name matches the substring. For example, "xyz" matches both "xyzabc" and "abcxyz."</p>
