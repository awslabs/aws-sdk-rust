    ///   - [`locale(Locale)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetBuiltinSlotTypes::locale) / [`set_locale(Option<Locale>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetBuiltinSlotTypes::set_locale): <p>A list of locales that the slot type supports.</p>

A slot type will be returned if any part of its signature matches the substring. For example, "xyz" matches both "xyzabc" and "abcxyz."</p>
