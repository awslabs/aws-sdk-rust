# aws-sdk-redshiftserverless

This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift Serverless. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift Serverless.

Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions data warehouse capacity and intelligently scales the underlying resources based on workload demands. Amazon Redshift Serverless adjusts capacity in seconds to deliver consistently high performance and simplified operations for even the most demanding and volatile workloads. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.

To learn more about Amazon Redshift Serverless, see [What is Amazon Redshift Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-whatis.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-redshiftserverless` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-redshiftserverless = "1.18.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_redshiftserverless as redshiftserverless;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), redshiftserverless::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_redshiftserverless::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-redshiftserverless/latest/aws_sdk_redshiftserverless/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
