                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`worker_group(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::poll_for_task::builders::PollForTaskFluentBuilder::worker_group) / [`set_worker_group(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::poll_for_task::builders::PollForTaskFluentBuilder::set_worker_group): <p>The type of task the task runner is configured to accept and process. The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipeline when they are created. You can only specify a single value for <code>workerGroup</code> in the call to <code>PollForTask</code>. There are no wildcard values permitted in <code>workerGroup</code>; the string must be an exact, case-sensitive, match.</p>
    ///   - [`hostname(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::poll_for_task::builders::PollForTaskFluentBuilder::hostname) / [`set_hostname(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::poll_for_task::builders::PollForTaskFluentBuilder::set_hostname): <p>The public DNS name of the calling task runner.</p>

You can get this value from the instance using <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id</code>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html">Instance Metadata</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.</i> Passing in this value proves that your task runner is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures the proper AWS Data Pipeline service charges are applied to your pipeline.</p>

One of the fields returned in this object is <code>taskId</code>, which contains an identifier for the task being assigned. The calling task runner uses <code>taskId</code> in subsequent calls to <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> and <code>SetTaskStatus</code>.</p>
