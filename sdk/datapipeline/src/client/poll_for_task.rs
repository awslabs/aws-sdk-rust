    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`PollForTask`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask) operation.
                            ///
                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`worker_group(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::worker_group) / [`set_worker_group(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::set_worker_group): <p>The type of task the task runner is configured to accept and process. The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipeline when they are created. You can only specify a single value for <code>workerGroup</code> in the call to <code>PollForTask</code>. There are no wildcard values permitted in <code>workerGroup</code>; the string must be an exact, case-sensitive, match.</p>
    ///   - [`hostname(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::hostname) / [`set_hostname(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::set_hostname): <p>The public DNS name of the calling task runner.</p>
    ///   - [`instance_identity(InstanceIdentity)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::instance_identity) / [`set_instance_identity(Option<InstanceIdentity>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PollForTask::set_instance_identity): <p>Identity information for the EC2 instance that is hosting the task runner. You can get this value from the instance using <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id</code>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html">Instance Metadata</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.</i> Passing in this value proves that your task runner is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures the proper AWS Data Pipeline service charges are applied to your pipeline.</p>

    ///   - [`task_object(Option<TaskObject>)`](crate::output::PollForTaskOutput::task_object): <p>The information needed to complete the task that is being assigned to the task runner. One of the fields returned in this object is <code>taskId</code>, which contains an identifier for the task being assigned. The calling task runner uses <code>taskId</code> in subsequent calls to <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> and <code>SetTaskStatus</code>.</p>
