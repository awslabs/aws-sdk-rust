//! <p>AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline
//! handles the details of scheduling and ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application
//! can focus on processing the data.</p>
//!
//! <p>AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner.
//! AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing
//! database queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use
//! AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide
//! custom data management.</p>
//!
//! <p>AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline
//! and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data.
//! Use the second set in your task runner application to receive the next task ready for processing.
//! The logic for performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting
//! the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs
//! the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so.
//! When the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
