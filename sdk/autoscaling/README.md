# aws-sdk-autoscaling

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is designed to automatically launch or terminate EC2 instances based on user-defined scaling policies, scheduled actions, and health checks.

For more information about Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, see the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html). For information about granting IAM users required permissions for calls to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, see [Granting IAM users required permissions for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/ec2-auto-scaling-api-permissions.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-autoscaling` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.9.0"
aws-sdk-autoscaling = "0.9.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
