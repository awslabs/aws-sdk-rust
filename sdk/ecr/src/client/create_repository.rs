If you do not specify a registry, the default registry is assumed.</p>
    ///   - [`repository_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::repository_name) / [`set_repository_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::set_repository_name): <p>The name to use for the repository. The repository name may be specified on its own (such as <code>nginx-web-app</code>) or it can be prepended with a namespace to group the repository into a category (such as <code>project-a/nginx-web-app</code>).</p>
    ///   - [`tags(Vec<Tag>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<Vec<Tag>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::set_tags): <p>The metadata that you apply to the repository to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.</p>

If this parameter is omitted, the default setting of <code>MUTABLE</code> will be used which will allow image tags to be overwritten. If <code>IMMUTABLE</code> is specified, all image tags within the repository will be immutable which will prevent them from being overwritten.</p>

This determines whether images are scanned for known vulnerabilities after being pushed to the repository.</p>
    ///   - [`encryption_configuration(EncryptionConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::encryption_configuration) / [`set_encryption_configuration(Option<EncryptionConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateRepository::set_encryption_configuration): <p>The encryption configuration for the repository.
