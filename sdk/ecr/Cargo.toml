description = "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry</fullname>\n        <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the\n            familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR\n            provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container\n            Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based\n            permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access\n            repositories and images.</p>"
