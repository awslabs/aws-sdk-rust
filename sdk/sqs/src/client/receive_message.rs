If a message is available, the call returns sooner than <code>WaitTimeSeconds</code>. If no messages are available and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.</p> <important>   <p>To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for <code>ReceiveMessage</code> requests is longer than the <code>WaitTimeSeconds</code> parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport settings using the <a href="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html"> NettyNioAsyncHttpClient</a> for asynchronous clients, or the <a href="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html"> ApacheHttpClient</a> for synchronous clients. </p>  </important>

If a networking issue occurs after a <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>You can use <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> only for 5 minutes after a <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action.</p> </li>   <li> <p>When you set <code>FifoQueue</code>, a caller of the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action can provide a <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> explicitly.</p> </li>   <li> <p>If a caller of the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action doesn't provide a <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code>, Amazon SQS generates a <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code>.</p> </li>   <li> <p>It is possible to retry the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action with the same <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes).</p> </li>   <li> <p>During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> <important>     <p>If a caller of the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error.</p>     <p>To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary.</p>    </important> </li>   <li> <p>While messages with a particular <code>MessageGroupId</code> are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same <code>MessageGroupId</code> are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another <code>MessageGroupId</code> as long as it is also visible.</p> </li>   <li> <p>If a caller of <code>ReceiveMessage</code> can't track the <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code>, no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order.</p> </li>  </ul>  <p>The maximum length of <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> is 128 characters. <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code> can contain alphanumeric characters (<code>a-z</code>, <code>A-Z</code>, <code>0-9</code>) and punctuation (<code>!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~</code>).</p>  <p>For best practices of using <code>ReceiveRequestAttemptId</code>, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-receiverequestattemptid-request-parameter.html">Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
