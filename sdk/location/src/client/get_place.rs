If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result.</p>  <p>For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a location around Athens, Greece, with the <code>language</code> parameter set to <code>en</code>. The <code>city</code> in the results will most likely be returned as <code>Athens</code>.</p>  <p>If you set the <code>language</code> parameter to <code>el</code>, for Greek, then the <code>city</code> in the results will more likely be returned as <code>Αθήνα</code>.</p>  <p>If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.</p>
