    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`GetPlace`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`index_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::index_name) / [`set_index_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::set_index_name): <p>The name of the place index resource that you want to use for the search.</p>
    ///   - [`place_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::place_id) / [`set_place_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::set_place_id): <p>The identifier of the place to find.</p>
    ///   - [`language(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::language) / [`set_language(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::set_language): <p>The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/search/bcp47">BCP 47</a> language tag, for example, <code>en</code> for English.</p>  <p>This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the results themselves. If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result.</p>  <p>For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a location around Athens, Greece, with the <code>language</code> parameter set to <code>en</code>. The <code>city</code> in the results will most likely be returned as <code>Athens</code>.</p>  <p>If you set the <code>language</code> parameter to <code>el</code>, for Greek, then the <code>city</code> in the results will more likely be returned as <code>Αθήνα</code>.</p>  <p>If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.</p>
