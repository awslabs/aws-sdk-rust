# aws-sdk-keyspacesstreams

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) change data capture (CDC) records change events for Amazon Keyspaces tables. The change events captured in a stream are time-ordered and de-duplicated write operations. Using stream data you can build event driven applications that incorporate near-real time change events from Amazon Keyspaces tables.

Amazon Keyspaces CDC is serverless and scales the infrastructure for change events automatically based on the volume of changes on your table.

This API reference describes the Amazon Keyspaces CDC stream API in detail.

For more information about Amazon Keyspaces CDC, see [Working with change data capture (CDC) streams in Amazon Keyspaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cdc.html) in the _Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide_.

To learn how Amazon Keyspaces CDC API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see [Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail) in the _Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide_.

To see the metrics Amazon Keyspaces CDC sends to Amazon CloudWatch, see [Amazon Keyspaces change data capture (CDC) CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/metrics-dimensions.html#keyspaces-cdc-metrics) in the _Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-keyspacesstreams` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-keyspacesstreams = "1.13.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_keyspacesstreams as keyspacesstreams;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), keyspacesstreams::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_keyspacesstreams::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-keyspacesstreams/latest/aws_sdk_keyspacesstreams/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
