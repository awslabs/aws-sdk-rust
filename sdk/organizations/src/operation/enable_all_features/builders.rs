/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `EnableAllFeatures`.
/// 
/// <p>Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that Organizations supports. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">Enabling All Features in Your Organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> <important> 
/// <p>This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.</p> 
/// </important> 
/// <p>After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using <code>EnablePolicyType</code> and <code>DisablePolicyType</code>. To see the status of policy types in a root, use <code>ListRoots</code>.</p> 
/// <p>After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains <code>"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"</code>. This completes the change.</p> 
/// <p>After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this.</p>
