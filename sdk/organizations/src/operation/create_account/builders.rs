/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateAccount`.
/// 
/// <p>Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because <code>CreateAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Use the <code>Id</code> value of the <code>CreateAccountStatus</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <code>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</code> operation.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Check the CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging and monitoring in Organizations</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>The user who calls the API to create an account must have the <code>organizations:CreateAccount</code> permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, Organizations creates the required service-linked role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs">Organizations and Service-Linked Roles</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> 
/// <p>If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission.</p> 
/// <p>Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named <code>OrganizationAccountAccessRole</code> by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account.</p> 
/// <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.</p> 
/// <p>For more information about creating accounts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html">Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> <important> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is <i>not</i> automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info"> To leave an organization as a member account</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Using <code>CreateAccount</code> to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html">Closing an Amazon Web Services account</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// </important> <note> 
/// <p>When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the <b>IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information</b> switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html">Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools</a>.</p>
