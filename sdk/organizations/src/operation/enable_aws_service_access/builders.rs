/// <p>Enables the integration of an Amazon Web Services service (the service that is specified by <code>ServicePrincipal</code>) with Organizations. When you enable integration, you allow the specified service to create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked role</a> in all the accounts in your organization. This allows the service to perform operations on your behalf in your organization and its accounts.</p> <important> 
/// <p>We recommend that you enable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is aware that it can create the resources that are required for the integration. How the service creates those resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.</p>
