/// <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html">Organizations</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <code>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</code> operation.</p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p>Check the CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event.

/// </ul>
/// <p></p>
/// <p>When you call the <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.</p>
/// <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html">Organizations</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide</i>.</p>

/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p>When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is <i>not</i> automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html">Considerations before removing an account from an organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p></li>

/// <li>
/// <p>Using <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user.

/// <p>When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the <b>IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information</b> switch enabled.
