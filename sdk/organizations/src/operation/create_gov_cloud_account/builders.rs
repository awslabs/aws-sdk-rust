/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>You're authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/welcome.html"> <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide</i>.</a> </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>You have the <code>organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount</code> permission. </p> </li> 
/// </ul>

/// <p>Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html">Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide</i>. </p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the <code>TagResource</code> operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists.</p> 
/// <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html">Organizations</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.</i> </p> 
/// <p>Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <code>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</code> operation.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Check the CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html">Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p></p> 
/// <p>When you call the <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.</p> 
/// <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html">Organizations</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.</i> </p> 
/// <p>For more information about creating accounts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html">Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> <important> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is <i>not</i> automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info"> To leave an organization as a member account</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services Support</a>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Using <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html">Closing an Amazon Web Services account</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide</i>.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// </important> <note> 
/// <p>When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the <b>IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information</b> switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html">Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools</a>.</p>
