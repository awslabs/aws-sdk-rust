A <code>NextToken</code> response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's <code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output should continue from.</p>

If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>NextToken</code> response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p>
