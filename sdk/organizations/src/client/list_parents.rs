    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`ListParents`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListParents) operation.

    ///   - [`child_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListParents::child_id) / [`set_child_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListParents::set_child_id): <p>The unique identifier (ID) of the OU or account whose parent containers you want to list. Don't specify a root.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex">regex pattern</a> for a child ID string requires one of the following:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <b>Account</b> - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <b>Organizational unit (OU)</b> - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.</p> </li>  </ul>

A <code>NextToken</code> response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's <code>NextToken</code> response to indicate where the output should continue from.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListParents::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListParents::set_max_results): <p>The total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the <code>NextToken</code> response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check <code>NextToken</code> after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.</p>

    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::ListParentsOutput::next_token): <p>If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the <code>NextToken</code> request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the <code>NextToken</code> response element comes back as <code>null</code>.</p>
