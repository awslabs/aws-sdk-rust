# aws-sdk-organizations

Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an _organization_ and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.

This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the [Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).

__Support and feedback for Organizations__

We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to [feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com](mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com) or post your feedback and questions in the [Organizations support forum](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219).

__Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK__

For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:
  - Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region: --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com _(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)_ or --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn _(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)_
  - Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command: aws configure set default.region us-east-1 _(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)_ or aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 _(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)_
  - Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint: --region us-east-1 _(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)_ or --region cn-northwest-1 _(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)_

__Recording API Requests__

Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see [Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration) in the _Organizations User Guide_. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-organizations` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-organizations = "1.19.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_organizations as organizations;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), organizations::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_organizations::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-organizations/latest/aws_sdk_organizations/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
