You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, <code>Z</code>. For example, <code>"2016-09-27T14:50Z"</code>.

If your resource received fewer requests than the value of <code>MaxItems</code>, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns information about all of them. </p>
