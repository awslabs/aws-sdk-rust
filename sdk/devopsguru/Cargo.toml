description = "<p> Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in business\n\t\t\tcritical operational applications. You specify the AWS resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover,\n\t\t\tthen the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and AWS CloudTrail events related to those resources are analyzed. When\n\t\t\tanomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an <i>insight</i> that includes\n\t\t\trecommendations, related events, and related metrics that can help you improve your\n\t\t\toperational applications. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">What is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>. </p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <p>\n\t\t\tYou can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate \n\t\t\tan OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager for each insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t       <p>\n\t\t\tTo learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works\">How DevOps Guru works</a>.
