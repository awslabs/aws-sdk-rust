//! This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API operations.
//! </p>
//! <p>
//! Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live applications, and provides
//! recommendations that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning
//! algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can
//! improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.
//! </p>
//! <p>
//! Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is
//! running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.
//! </p>
//! <note>
//! <p>Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM)
//! languages and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and recommendations for applications
//! written in Java, it can also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for
//! applications written in other JVM languages and Python.</p>
//! </note>
//! <p>
//! For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-ug/what-is-codeguru-profiler.html">What is Amazon CodeGuru Profiler</a> in 
//! the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Profiler User Guide</i>.

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.


// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
