# aws-sdk-codeguruprofiler

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API operations.

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live applications, and provides recommendations that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.

For more information, see [What is Amazon CodeGuru Profiler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-ug/what-is-codeguru-profiler.html) in the _Amazon CodeGuru Profiler User Guide_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are availble for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-codeguruprofiler` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.22-alpha"
aws-sdk-codeguruprofiler = "0.0.22-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
