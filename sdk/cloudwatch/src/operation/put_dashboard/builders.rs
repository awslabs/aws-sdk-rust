/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `PutDashboard`.
/// 
/// <p>Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.</p> 
/// <p>All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.</p> 
/// <p>A simple way to create a dashboard using <code>PutDashboard</code> is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>.</p> 
/// <p>When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the <code>DashboardBody</code> script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.</p>
