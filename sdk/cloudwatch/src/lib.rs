//! <p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) resources and the
//! applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track
//! metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and
//! applications.</p>
//!
//! <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules
//! that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
//! instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
//! additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop
//! under-used instances to save
//! money.</p>
//!
//! <p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you can monitor
//! your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource
//! utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/cloudwatch).
