/// <p>A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish <code>InstanceId</code> as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.</p>
