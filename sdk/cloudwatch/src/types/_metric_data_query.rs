/// <p>This structure is used in both <code>GetMetricData</code> and <code>PutMetricAlarm</code>. The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.</p> 
/// <p>When used in <code>GetMetricData</code>, it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Metrics Insights query or a math expression. A single <code>GetMetricData</code> call can include up to 500 <code>MetricDataQuery</code> structures.</p> 
/// <p>When used in <code>PutMetricAlarm</code>, it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each <code>MetricDataQuery</code> in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single <code>PutMetricAlarm</code> call can include up to 20 <code>MetricDataQuery</code> structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a <code>MetricStat</code> parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the <code>Expression</code> parameter to perform a math expression. Of those <code>Expression</code> structures, one must have <code>true</code> as the value for <code>ReturnData</code>. The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.</p> 
/// <p>Any expression used in a <code>PutMetricAlarm</code> operation must return a single time series.
