    ///   - [`created_by(Option<RecoveryPointCreator>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::created_by): <p>Contains identifying information about the creation of a recovery point, including the <code>BackupPlanArn</code>, <code>BackupPlanId</code>, <code>BackupPlanVersion</code>, and <code>BackupRuleId</code> of the backup plan used to create it.</p>

    ///   - [`status(Option<RecoveryPointStatus>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::status): <p>A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.</p>  <p> <code>PARTIAL</code> status indicates Backup could not create the recovery point before the backup window closed. To increase your backup plan window using the API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_UpdateBackupPlan.html">UpdateBackupPlan</a>. You can also increase your backup plan window using the Console by choosing and editing your backup plan.</p>  <p> <code>EXPIRED</code> status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups"> Step 3: Delete the recovery points</a> in the <i>Clean up resources</i> section of <i>Getting started</i>.</p>  <p> <code>STOPPED</code> status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup.</p>  <p>To resolve <code>STOPPED</code> status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.</p>  <p>For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 <code>STOPPED</code> status occurs due to user action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that future continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status and check SAP HANA for details.</p>
