    ///   - [`source_backup_vault_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::source_backup_vault_arn): <p>An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source vault where the resource was originally backed up in; for example, <code>arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:BackupVault</code>. If the recovery is restored to the same Amazon Web Services account or Region, this value will be <code>null</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::resource_arn): <p>An ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_type(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::resource_type): <p>The type of Amazon Web Services resource to save as a recovery point; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.</p>
    ///   - [`created_by(Option<RecoveryPointCreator>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::created_by): <p>Contains identifying information about the creation of a recovery point, including the <code>BackupPlanArn</code>, <code>BackupPlanId</code>, <code>BackupPlanVersion</code>, and <code>BackupRuleId</code> of the backup plan used to create it.</p>
    ///   - [`iam_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::iam_role_arn): <p>Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`status(Option<RecoveryPointStatus>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::status): <p>A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.</p>  <p> <code>PARTIAL</code> status indicates Backup could not create the recovery point before the backup window closed. To increase your backup plan window using the API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_UpdateBackupPlan.html">UpdateBackupPlan</a>. You can also increase your backup plan window using the Console by choosing and editing your backup plan.</p>  <p> <code>EXPIRED</code> status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups"> Step 3: Delete the recovery points</a> in the <i>Clean up resources</i> section of <i>Getting started</i>.</p>  <p> <code>STOPPED</code> status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup.</p>  <p>To resolve <code>STOPPED</code> status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.</p>
    ///   - [`status_message(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::status_message): <p>A status message explaining the reason for the recovery point deletion failure.</p>
    ///   - [`creation_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::creation_date): <p>The date and time that a recovery point is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    ///   - [`completion_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::completion_date): <p>The date and time that a job to create a recovery point is completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    ///   - [`backup_size_in_bytes(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::backup_size_in_bytes): <p>The size, in bytes, of a backup.</p>
    ///   - [`calculated_lifecycle(Option<CalculatedLifecycle>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::calculated_lifecycle): <p>A <code>CalculatedLifecycle</code> object containing <code>DeleteAt</code> and <code>MoveToColdStorageAt</code> timestamps.</p>
    ///   - [`lifecycle(Option<Lifecycle>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::lifecycle): <p>The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.</p>  <p>Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold. </p>  <p>Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage are listed in the "Lifecycle to cold storage" section of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html#features-by-resource"> Feature availability by resource</a> table.

    ///   - [`composite_member_identifier(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_recovery_point::DescribeRecoveryPointOutput::composite_member_identifier): <p>This is the identifier of a resource within a composite group, such as nested (child) recovery point belonging to a composite (parent) stack.
