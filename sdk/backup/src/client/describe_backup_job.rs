Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_vault_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_vault_arn): <p>An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup vault; for example, <code>arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault</code>.</p>

    ///   - [`resource_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::resource_arn): <p>An ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.</p>
    ///   - [`creation_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::creation_date): <p>The date and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>CreationDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`completion_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::completion_date): <p>The date and time that a job to create a backup job is completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>CompletionDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>

    ///   - [`percent_done(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::percent_done): <p>Contains an estimated percentage that is complete of a job at the time the job status was queried.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_size_in_bytes(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_size_in_bytes): <p>The size, in bytes, of a backup.</p>
    ///   - [`iam_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::iam_role_arn): <p>Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`created_by(Option<RecoveryPointCreator>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::created_by): <p>Contains identifying information about the creation of a backup job, including the <code>BackupPlanArn</code>, <code>BackupPlanId</code>, <code>BackupPlanVersion</code>, and <code>BackupRuleId</code> of the backup plan that is used to create it.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_type(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::resource_type): <p>The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.</p>
    ///   - [`bytes_transferred(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::bytes_transferred): <p>The size in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time that the job status was queried.</p>
    ///   - [`expected_completion_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::expected_completion_date): <p>The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to be completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>ExpectedCompletionDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`start_by(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::start_by): <p>Specifies the time in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start window to the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is 2 hours, the <code>StartBy</code> time would be 8:00 PM on the date specified. The value of <code>StartBy</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_options(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_options): <p>Represents the options specified as part of backup plan or on-demand backup job.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_type(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_type): <p>Represents the actual backup type selected for a backup job. For example, if a successful Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup was taken, <code>BackupType</code> returns <code>"WindowsVSS"</code>. If <code>BackupType</code> is empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.</p>
    ///   - [`parent_job_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::parent_job_id): <p>This returns the parent (composite) resource backup job ID.</p>
    ///   - [`is_parent(bool)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::is_parent): <p>This returns the boolean value that a backup job is a parent (composite) job.</p>
    ///   - [`number_of_child_jobs(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::number_of_child_jobs): <p>This returns the number of child (nested) backup jobs.</p>
    ///   - [`child_jobs_in_state(Option<HashMap<BackupJobState, i64>>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::child_jobs_in_state): <p>This returns the statistics of the included child (nested) backup jobs.</p>
