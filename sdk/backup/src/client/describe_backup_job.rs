Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.

    ///   - [`creation_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::creation_date): <p>The date and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>CreationDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`completion_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::completion_date): <p>The date and time that a job to create a backup job is completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>CompletionDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>

    ///   - [`percent_done(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::percent_done): <p>Contains an estimated percentage that is complete of a job at the time the job status was queried.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_size_in_bytes(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_size_in_bytes): <p>The size, in bytes, of a backup.</p>
    ///   - [`iam_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::iam_role_arn): <p>Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`created_by(Option<RecoveryPointCreator>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::created_by): <p>Contains identifying information about the creation of a backup job, including the <code>BackupPlanArn</code>, <code>BackupPlanId</code>, <code>BackupPlanVersion</code>, and <code>BackupRuleId</code> of the backup plan that is used to create it.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_type(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::resource_type): <p>The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.</p>
    ///   - [`bytes_transferred(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::bytes_transferred): <p>The size in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time that the job status was queried.</p>
    ///   - [`expected_completion_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::expected_completion_date): <p>The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to be completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>ExpectedCompletionDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`start_by(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::start_by): <p>Specifies the time in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start window to the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is 2 hours, the <code>StartBy</code> time would be 8:00 PM on the date specified. The value of <code>StartBy</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_options(Option<HashMap::<String, String>>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_options): <p>Represents the options specified as part of backup plan or on-demand backup job.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_type(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::backup_type): <p>Represents the actual backup type selected for a backup job. For example, if a successful Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup was taken, <code>BackupType</code> returns <code>"WindowsVSS"</code>. If <code>BackupType</code> is empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.</p>
    ///   - [`parent_job_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::parent_job_id): <p>This returns the parent (composite) resource backup job ID.</p>

    ///   - [`number_of_child_jobs(Option<i64>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::number_of_child_jobs): <p>This returns the number of child (nested) backup jobs.</p>
    ///   - [`child_jobs_in_state(Option<HashMap::<BackupJobState, i64>>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::child_jobs_in_state): <p>This returns the statistics of the included child (nested) backup jobs.</p>
    ///   - [`resource_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_backup_job::DescribeBackupJobOutput::resource_name): <p>This is the non-unique name of the resource that belongs to the specified backup.</p>
