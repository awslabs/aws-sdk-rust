Includes a <code>BackupPlanName</code> and one or more sets of <code>Rules</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_plan_tags(HashMap<String, String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateBackupPlan::backup_plan_tags) / [`set_backup_plan_tags(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateBackupPlan::set_backup_plan_tags): <p>To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair. The specified tags are assigned to all backups created with this plan.</p>

If the request includes a <code>CreatorRequestId</code> that matches an existing backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.</p>  <p>If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.</p>

    ///   - [`backup_plan_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::CreateBackupPlanOutput::backup_plan_id): <p>Uniquely identifies a backup plan.</p>
    ///   - [`backup_plan_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::output::CreateBackupPlanOutput::backup_plan_arn): <p>An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup plan; for example, <code>arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`creation_date(Option<DateTime>)`](crate::output::CreateBackupPlanOutput::creation_date): <p>The date and time that a backup plan is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of <code>CreationDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`version_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::CreateBackupPlanOutput::version_id): <p>Unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be edited.</p>
    ///   - [`advanced_backup_settings(Option<Vec<AdvancedBackupSetting>>)`](crate::output::CreateBackupPlanOutput::advanced_backup_settings): <p>A list of <code>BackupOptions</code> settings for a resource type. This option is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.</p>
