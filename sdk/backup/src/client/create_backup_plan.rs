The value of <code>CreationDate</code> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.</p>
    ///   - [`version_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_backup_plan::CreateBackupPlanOutput::version_id): <p>Unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be edited.</p>
