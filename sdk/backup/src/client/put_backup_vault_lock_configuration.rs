This setting can be useful if, for example, your organization's policies require you to retain certain data for at least seven years (2555 days).</p>  <p>If this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock will not enforce a minimum retention period.</p>  <p>If this parameter is specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a retention period equal to or longer than the minimum retention period. If the job's retention period is shorter than that minimum retention period, then the vault fails that backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The shortest minimum retention period you can specify is 1 day. Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.</p>

If the job's retention period is longer than that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different vault. The longest maximum retention period you can specify is 36500 days (approximately 100 years). Recovery points already saved in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not affected.</p>
