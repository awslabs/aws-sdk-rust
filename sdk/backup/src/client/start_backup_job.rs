    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`StartBackupJob`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder) operation.

Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.</p><br>
    ///   - [`resource_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::resource_arn) / [`set_resource_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::set_resource_arn):<br>required: **true**<br><p>An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.</p><br>
    ///   - [`iam_role_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::iam_role_arn) / [`set_iam_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::set_iam_role_arn):<br>required: **true**<br><p>Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access</code>.</p><br>
    ///   - [`idempotency_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::idempotency_token) / [`set_idempotency_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_backup_job::builders::StartBackupJobFluentBuilder::set_idempotency_token):<br>required: **false**<br><p>A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical calls to <code>StartBackupJob</code>. Retrying a successful request with the same idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.</p><br>

This value is optional, and the default is 8 hours. If this value is included, it must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.</p> <p>This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).</p> <p>During the start window, the backup job status remains in <code>CREATED</code> status until it has successfully begun or until the start window time has run out. If within the start window time Backup receives an error that allows the job to be retried, Backup will automatically retry to begin the job at least every 10 minutes until the backup successfully begins (the job status changes to <code>RUNNING</code>) or until the job status changes to <code>EXPIRED</code> (which is expected to occur when the start window time is over).</p><br>

This value is optional. This value begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time for <code>StartWindowMinutes</code>, or if the backup started later than scheduled.</p> <p>Like <code>StartWindowMinutes</code>, this parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).</p><br>

Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.</p> <p>Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.</p> <p>Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage are listed in the "Lifecycle to cold storage" section of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html#features-by-resource"> Feature availability by resource</a> table.

This option is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.</p> <p>Valid values: Set to <code>"WindowsVSS":"enabled"</code> to enable the <code>WindowsVSS</code> backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.
