/// <p>Contains an array of <code>Transition</code> objects specifying how long in days before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.</p>
/// <p>Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.</p>

Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.</p>
