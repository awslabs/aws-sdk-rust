# aws-sdk-amp

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for container metrics that makes it easier to securely monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus data model and query language that you use today to monitor the performance of your containerized workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability, availability, and security without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

For more information about Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, see the [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Prometheus.html) User Guide.

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus includes two APIs.
  - Use the Amazon Web Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups, and alert managers.
  - Use the [Prometheus-compatible API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference.html#AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis) to work within your Prometheus workspace.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-amp` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-amp = "1.21.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_amp as amp;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), amp::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_amp::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-amp/latest/aws_sdk_amp/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
