The name is unique for each <code>ConnectorProfile</code> in the Amazon Web Services account, and is used to query the downstream connector. </p>
    ///   - [`connector_type(ConnectorType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::connector_type) / [`set_connector_type(Option<ConnectorType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::set_connector_type): <p> The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on. </p>

Some connectors support multiple levels or categories of entities. You can find out the list of roots for such providers by sending a request without the <code>entitiesPath</code> parameter. If the connector supports entities at different roots, this initial request returns the list of roots. Otherwise, this request returns all entities supported by the provider. </p>

    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of items that the operation returns in the response.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListConnectorEntities::set_next_token): <p>A token that was provided by your prior <code>ListConnectorEntities</code> operation if the response was too big for the page size. You specify this token to get the next page of results in paginated response.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`ListConnectorEntitiesOutput`](crate::output::ListConnectorEntitiesOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`connector_entity_map(Option<HashMap<String, Vec<ConnectorEntity>>>)`](crate::output::ListConnectorEntitiesOutput::connector_entity_map): <p> The response of <code>ListConnectorEntities</code> lists entities grouped by category. This map's key represents the group name, and its value contains the list of entities belonging to that group. </p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::ListConnectorEntitiesOutput::next_token): <p>A token that you specify in your next <code>ListConnectorEntities</code> operation to get the next page of results in paginated response. The <code>ListConnectorEntities</code> operation provides this token if the response is too big for the page size.</p>
