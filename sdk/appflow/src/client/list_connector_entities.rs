The name is unique for each <code>ConnectorProfile</code> in the Amazon Web Services account, and is used to query the downstream connector. </p>

Some connectors support multiple levels or categories of entities. You can find out the list of roots for such providers by sending a request without the <code>entitiesPath</code> parameter. If the connector supports entities at different roots, this initial request returns the list of roots. Otherwise, this request returns all entities supported by the provider. </p>
