//! <note>
//! <p>Amazon Security Lake is in preview release. Your use of the Security Lake preview is subject to
//! Section 2 of the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/">Amazon Web Services Service
//! Terms</a>("Betas and Previews").</p>
//! </note>
//! <p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You can use Security Lake to
//! automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a
//! data lake that's stored in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount. Amazon Web Services Organizations
//! is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services
//! accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you
//! can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization.
//! Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your
//! security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the
//! protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p>
//! <p>The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you
//! retain ownership over your data.   </p>
//! <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of
//! actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service in Security Lake CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls
//! from the Security Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations. If you create a
//! trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still
//! view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the
//! information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made to
//! Security Lake, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it
//! was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data from
//! integrated Amazon Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage
//! the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings. Security Lake
//! converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called
//! the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).</p>
//! <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for 
//! incident response and security data analytics.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
