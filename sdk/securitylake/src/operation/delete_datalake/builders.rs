/// <p>When you delete Amazon Security Lake from your account, Security Lake is disabled in all Amazon Web Services Regions. Also, this API automatically takes steps to remove the account from Security Lake . </p> 
/// <p>This operation disables security data collection from sources, deletes data stored, and stops making data accessible to subscribers. Security Lake also deletes all the existing settings and resources that it stores or maintains for your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region, including security log and event data. The <code>DeleteDatalake</code> operation does not delete the Amazon S3 bucket, which is owned by your Amazon Web Services account.
