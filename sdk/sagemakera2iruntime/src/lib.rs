//! Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence, human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a _worker task template_, a _flow definition_, and a _human loop_.
//!
//! For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see [Get Started with Amazon Augmented AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//!
//! This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:
//!   - Start a human loop with the StartHumanLoop operation when using Amazon A2I with a _custom task type_. To learn more about the difference between custom and built-in task types, see [Use Task Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html). To learn how to start a human loop using this API, see [Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//!   - Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see [Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//!
//! Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human review workflows for those services. To learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs, see [Use APIs in Amazon A2I](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-api-references.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-sagemakera2iruntime` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = { version = "1.1.4", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
//! aws-sdk-sagemakera2iruntime = "1.12.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_sagemakera2iruntime as sagemakera2iruntime;
//!
//! #[::tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), sagemakera2iruntime::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = aws_sdk_sagemakera2iruntime::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-sagemakera2iruntime/latest/aws_sdk_sagemakera2iruntime/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by Amazon Augmented AI Runtime. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling Amazon Augmented AI Runtime.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_sagemakera2iruntime::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific values that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = ::aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_sagemakera2iruntime::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`DeleteHumanLoop`](crate::operation::delete_human_loop) operation has
/// a [`Client::delete_human_loop`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `send()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.delete_human_loop()
///     .human_loop_name("example")
///     .send()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
