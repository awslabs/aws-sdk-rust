//! <p>Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning
//! application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence,
//! human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create
//! and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a <i>worker task
//! template</i>, a <i>flow definition</i>, and a <i>human
//! loop</i>.</p>
//! <p>For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html">Get Started with
//! Amazon Augmented AI</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
//! <p>This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use
//! to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Start a human loop with the <code>StartHumanLoop</code> operation when using
//! Amazon A2I with a <i>custom task type</i>. To learn more about the
//! difference between custom and built-in task types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html">Use Task Types </a>. To learn
//! how to start a human loop using this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop">Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type </a> in the
//! Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe
//! individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html">Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop </a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human review
//! workflows for those services. To learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-api-references.html">Use APIs in
//! Amazon A2I</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
