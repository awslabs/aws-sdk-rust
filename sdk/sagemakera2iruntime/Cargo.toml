description = "<p>Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning\n      application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence,\n      human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create\n      and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a <i>worker task\n        template</i>, a <i>flow definition</i>, and a <i>human\n        loop</i>.</p>\n         <p>For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html\">Get Started with\n        Amazon Augmented AI</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>\n         <p>This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use\n      to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Start a human loop with the <code>StartHumanLoop</code> operation when using\n          Amazon A2I with a <i>custom task type</i>. To learn more about the\n          difference between custom and built-in task types, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html\">Use Task Types </a>. To learn\n          how to start a human loop using this API, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop\">Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type </a> in the\n          Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe\n          individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html\">Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop </a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human review\n      workflows for those services. To learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-api-references.html\">Use APIs in\n        Amazon A2I</a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.</p>"
