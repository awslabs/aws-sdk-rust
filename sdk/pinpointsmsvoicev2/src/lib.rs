//! <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API Reference</i>.
//! This guide provides information about Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API
//! resources, including supported HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas.</p>
//! <p>Amazon Pinpoint is an Amazon Web Services service that you can use to engage with
//! your recipients across multiple messaging channels. The Amazon Pinpoint SMS and
//! Voice, version 2 API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the SMS
//! and voice channels and supplements the resources provided by the Amazon Pinpoint
//! API.</p>
//! <p>If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, it's also helpful to review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">
//! Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint
//! Developer Guide</i> provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that
//! demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate
//! Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications.
//! The guide also provides key information, such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with
//! other Amazon Web Services services, and the quotas that apply to use of the
//! service.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
