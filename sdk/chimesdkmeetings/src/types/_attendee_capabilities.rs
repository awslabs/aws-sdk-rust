/// <p>The media capabilities of an attendee: audio, video, or content. </p> <note> 
/// <p>You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the capabilities can do, such as <code>SendReceive</code> data. For more information about those values, see .</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>You can't set <code>content</code> capabilities to <code>SendReceive</code> or <code>Receive</code> unless you also set <code>video</code> capabilities to <code>SendReceive</code> or <code>Receive</code>. If you don't set the <code>video</code> capability to receive, the response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you can set your <code>video</code> capability to receive and you set your <code>content</code> capability to not receive.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>When you change an <code>audio</code> capability from <code>None</code> or <code>Receive</code> to <code>Send</code> or <code>SendReceive</code> , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>When you change a <code>video</code> or <code>content</code> capability from <code>None</code> or <code>Receive</code> to <code>Send</code> or <code>SendReceive</code> , and if the attendee turned on their video or content streams, remote attendess can receive those streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.</p> </li>
