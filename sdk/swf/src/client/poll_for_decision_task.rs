It must not contain a <code>:</code> (colon), <code>/</code> (slash), <code>|</code> (vertical bar), or any control characters (<code>\u0000-\u001f</code> | <code>\u007f-\u009f</code>). Also, it must not <i>be</i> the literal string <code>arn</code>.</p>

This enables diagnostic tracing when problems arise. The form of this identity is user defined.</p>

The value of <code>NextPageToken</code> is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 60 seconds. Using an expired pagination token will return a <code>400</code> error: "<code>Specified token has exceeded its maximum lifetime</code>". </p>  <p>The configured <code>maximumPageSize</code> determines how many results can be returned in a single call. </p> <note>   <p>The <code>nextPageToken</code> returned by this action cannot be used with <code>GetWorkflowExecutionHistory</code> to get the next page. You must call <code>PollForDecisionTask</code> again (with the <code>nextPageToken</code>) to retrieve the next page of history records. Calling <code>PollForDecisionTask</code> with a <code>nextPageToken</code> doesn't return a new decision task.</p>  </note>

    ///   - [`started_event_id(i64)`](crate::operation::poll_for_decision_task::PollForDecisionTaskOutput::started_event_id): <p>The ID of the <code>DecisionTaskStarted</code> event recorded in the history.</p>
