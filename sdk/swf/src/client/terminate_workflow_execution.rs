This policy overrides the child policy specified for the workflow execution at registration time or when starting the execution.</p>  <p>The supported child policies are:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>TERMINATE</code> – The child executions are terminated.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>REQUEST_CANCEL</code> – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a <code>WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested</code> event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>ABANDON</code> – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.</p> </li>  </ul> <note>   <p>A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.</p>  </note>
