description = "<fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname>\n\n         <p>The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to\n      coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i>\n      represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow.\n      Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and \n      concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.</p>\n\n         <p>Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without\n      worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their\n      state.</p>\n\n         <p>This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF\n      programming model, see the <i>\n               <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a>\n            </i>.</p>"
