/// <p>In a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html"> <code>BatchImportFindings</code> </a> request, finding providers use <code>FindingProviderFields</code> to provide and update values for the following fields:</p>
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>Confidence</code></p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>Criticality</code></p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>RelatedFindings</code></p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>Severity</code></p></li>
/// <li>
/// <p><code>Types</code></p></li>
/// </ul>
/// <p>The preceding fields are nested under the <code>FindingProviderFields</code> object, but also have analogues of the same name as top-level ASFF fields. When a new finding is sent to Security Hub by a finding provider, Security Hub populates the <code>FindingProviderFields</code> object automatically, if it is empty, based on the corresponding top-level fields.</p>
/// <p>Finding providers can update <code>FindingProviderFields</code> only by using the <code>BatchImportFindings</code> operation. Finding providers can't update this object with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html"> <code>BatchUpdateFindings</code> </a> operation. Customers can update the top-level fields by using the <code>BatchUpdateFindings</code> operation. Customers can't update <code>FindingProviderFields</code>.</p>
