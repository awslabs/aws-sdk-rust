/// <p>Contains information about the network connection involved in an Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection attack sequence. GuardDuty generates an attack sequence finding when multiple events align to a potentially suspicious activity. To receive GuardDuty attack sequence findings in Security Hub, you must have GuardDuty and GuardDuty S3 Protection enabled. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-extended-threat-detection.html">GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection </a> in the <i>Amazon GuardDuty User Guide</i>.</p>
