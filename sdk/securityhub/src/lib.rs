//! <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness status
//! of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects
//! security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps
//! you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security
//! issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
//! <i>Security HubUser
//! Guide</i>
//! </a>.</p>
//! <p>When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services
//! Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your
//! request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied
//! only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for
//! each Region to apply the change to.</p>
//! <p>For example, if your Region is set to <code>us-west-2</code>, when you use <code>CreateMembers</code> to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of
//! the member account with the administrator account is created only in the <code>us-west-2</code>
//! Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation
//! was sent from.</p>
//! <p>The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 1
//! request per second, <code>BurstLimit</code> of 1 request per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>GetFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 3 requests per second.
//! <code>BurstLimit</code> of 6 requests per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>BatchImportFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 10 requests per second.
//! <code>BurstLimit</code> of 30 requests per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>BatchUpdateFindings</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of 10 requests per second.
//! <code>BurstLimit</code> of 30 requests per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>
//! <code>UpdateStandardsControl</code> - <code>RateLimit</code> of
//! 1 request per second, <code>BurstLimit</code> of 5 requests per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>All other operations - <code>RateLimit</code> of 10 requests per second.
//! <code>BurstLimit</code> of 30 requests per second.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
