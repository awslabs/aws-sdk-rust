//! Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in Amazon Web Services and helps you assess your Amazon Web Services environment against security industry standards and best practices.
//!
//! Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services accounts, Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues.
//!
//! To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices.
//!
//! In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web Services and supported third-party products.
//!
//! Security Hub offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues. For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to specific findings.
//!
//! This guide, the _Security Hub API Reference_, provides information about the Security Hub API. This includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the [_Security Hub User Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html). The user guide explains key concepts and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features. It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub with other Amazon Web Services.
//!
//! In addition to interacting with Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about installing and using the Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/).
//!
//! With the exception of operations that are related to central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see the [Central configuration terms and concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts) section of the _Security Hub User Guide_.
//!
//! The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub API operations.
//!   - BatchEnableStandards - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 1 request per second.
//!   - GetFindings - RateLimit of 3 requests per second. BurstLimit of 6 requests per second.
//!   - BatchImportFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
//!   - BatchUpdateFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
//!   - UpdateStandardsControl - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.
//!   - All other operations - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-securityhub` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
//! aws-sdk-securityhub = "1.18.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_securityhub as securityhub;
//!
//! #[::tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), securityhub::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = aws_sdk_securityhub::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-securityhub/latest/aws_sdk_securityhub/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by AWS SecurityHub. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling AWS SecurityHub.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_securityhub::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific values that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = ::aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_securityhub::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`AcceptAdministratorInvitation`](crate::operation::accept_administrator_invitation) operation has
/// a [`Client::accept_administrator_invitation`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `send()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.accept_administrator_invitation()
///     .administrator_id("example")
///     .send()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
