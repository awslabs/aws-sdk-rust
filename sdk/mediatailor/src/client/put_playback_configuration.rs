If the duration of underfilled ad time exceeds the personalization threshold, then the personalization of the ad break is abandoned and the underlying content is shown. This feature applies to <i>ad replacement</i> in live and VOD streams, rather than ad insertion, because it relies on an underlying content stream.

AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows the slate to fill in gaps in media content. Configuring the slate is optional for non-VPAID configurations. For VPAID, the slate is required because MediaTailor provides it in the slots that are designated for dynamic ad content.
