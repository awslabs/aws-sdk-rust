You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from <code>DeleteProject</code>. In this case, safely retry your call to <code>DeleteProject</code> by using the same <code>ClientToken</code> parameter value. </p>  <p>If you don't supply a value for <code>ClientToken</code>, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple project deletion requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. </p>  <p>An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for <code>ClientToken</code> is considered a new call to <code>DeleteProject</code>. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.</p><br>
