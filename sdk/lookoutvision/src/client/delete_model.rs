    ///   - [`model_version(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteModel::model_version) / [`set_model_version(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DeleteModel::set_model_version): <p>The version of the model that you want to delete.</p>

You choose the value to pass. For example, an issue might prevent you from getting a response from <code>DeleteModel</code>. In this case, safely retry your call to <code>DeleteModel</code> by using the same <code>ClientToken</code> parameter value.</p>  <p>If you don't supply a value for ClientToken, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple model deletion requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. </p>  <p>An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for <code>ClientToken</code> is considered a new call to <code>DeleteModel</code>. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.</p>
