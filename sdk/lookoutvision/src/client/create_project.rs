    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`project_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateProject::project_name) / [`set_project_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateProject::set_project_name): <p>The name for the project.</p>

You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from <code>CreateProject</code>. In this case, safely retry your call to <code>CreateProject</code> by using the same <code>ClientToken</code> parameter value. </p>  <p>If you don't supply a value for <code>ClientToken</code>, the AWS SDK you are using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network error from making multiple project creation requests. You'll need to provide your own value for other use cases. </p>  <p>An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for <code>ClientToken</code> is considered a new call to <code>CreateProject</code>. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.</p>
