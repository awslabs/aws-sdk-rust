description = "<fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname>\n         <p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary\n         credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a\n         device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an\n         application.</p>\n         <p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or\n         more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon\n         Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.\n         Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider\n         trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS\n         credentials.</p>\n         <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide\n         see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html\">Authentication Flow</a>.</p>\n         <p>For more information see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html\">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>.</p>"
