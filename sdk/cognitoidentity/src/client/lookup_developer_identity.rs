    ///   - [`identity_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::LookupDeveloperIdentity::identity_id) / [`set_identity_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::LookupDeveloperIdentity::set_identity_id): <p>A unique identifier in the format REGION:GUID.</p>

Typically, a developer identity provider would issue many developer user identifiers, in keeping with the number of users.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::LookupDeveloperIdentity::max_results) / [`set_max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::LookupDeveloperIdentity::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of identities to return.</p>

The first call you make will have <code>NextToken</code> set to null. After that the service will return <code>NextToken</code> values as needed. For example, let's say you make a request with <code>MaxResults</code> set to 10, and there are 20 matches in the database. The service will return a pagination token as a part of the response. This token can be used to call the API again and get results starting from the 11th match.</p>

    ///   - [`developer_user_identifier_list(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::output::LookupDeveloperIdentityOutput::developer_user_identifier_list): <p>This is the list of developer user identifiers associated with an identity ID. Cognito supports the association of multiple developer user identifiers with an identity ID.</p>
