//! <fullname>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary
//! credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a
//! device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an
//! application.</p>
//! <p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or
//! more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon
//! Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.
//! Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider
//! trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
//! credentials.</p>
//! <p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide
//! see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html">Authentication Flow</a>.</p>
//! <p>For more information see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>.</p>
//! 
//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//! 
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/cognitoidentity).
