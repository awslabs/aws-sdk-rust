/// <p>Describes a policy used by EFS lifecycle management and EFS Intelligent-Tiering that specifies when to transition files into and out of the file system's Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html">EFS Intelligent‐Tiering and EFS Lifecycle Management</a>.</p> <note> 
/// <p>When using the <code>put-lifecycle-configuration</code> CLI command or the <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> API action, Amazon EFS requires that each <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> object have only a single transition. This means that in a request body, <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> must be structured as an array of <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> objects, one object for each transition, <code>TransitionToIA</code>, <code>TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass</code>. For more information, see the request examples in <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code>.</p>
