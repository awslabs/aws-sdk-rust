/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateFileSystem`.
/// 
/// <p>Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's Amazon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state <code>creating</code>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Returns with the description of the created file system.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>Otherwise, this operation returns a <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code> error with the ID of the existing file system.</p> <note> 
/// <p>For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p> The idempotent operation allows you to retry a <code>CreateFileSystem</code> call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code> error.</p> 
/// <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/creating-using-create-fs.html#creating-using-create-fs-part1">Creating a file system</a> in the <i>Amazon EFS User Guide</i>.</p> <note> 
/// <p>The <code>CreateFileSystem</code> call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still <code>creating</code>. You can check the file system creation status by calling the <code>DescribeFileSystems</code> operation, which among other things returns the file system state.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>This operation accepts an optional <code>PerformanceMode</code> parameter that you choose for your file system. We recommend <code>generalPurpose</code> performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the <code>maxIO</code> performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html">Amazon EFS performance modes</a>.</p> 
/// <p>You can set the throughput mode for the file system using the <code>ThroughputMode</code> parameter.</p> 
/// <p>After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to <code>available</code>, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see <code>CreateMountTarget</code>. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by using the mount target.
