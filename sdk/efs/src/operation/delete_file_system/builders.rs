/// <p>Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents. Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access any contents of the deleted file system.</p> 
/// <p>You need to manually delete mount targets attached to a file system before you can delete an EFS file system. This step is performed for you when you use the Amazon Web Services console to delete a file system.</p> <note> 
/// <p>You cannot delete a file system that is part of an EFS Replication configuration. You need to delete the replication configuration first.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p> You can't delete a file system that is in use. That is, if the file system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more information, see <code>DescribeMountTargets</code> and <code>DeleteMountTarget</code>. </p> <note> 
/// <p>The <code>DeleteFileSystem</code> call returns while the file system state is still <code>deleting</code>. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the <code>DescribeFileSystems</code> operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation token for the deleted file system, the <code>DescribeFileSystems</code> returns a <code>404 FileSystemNotFound</code> error.</p>
