We recommend <code>generalPurpose</code> performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the <code>maxIO</code> performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.</p> <note>   <p>The <code>maxIO</code> mode is not supported on file systems using One Zone storage classes.</p>  </note>

When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying an existing Key Management Service key (KMS key). If you don't specify a KMS key, then the default KMS key for Amazon EFS, <code>/aws/elasticfilesystem</code>, is used to protect the encrypted file system. </p>

This parameter is required only if you want to use a non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using the following formats:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example <code>1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab</code>.</p> </li>   <li> <p>ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example <code>arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab</code>.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example <code>alias/projectKey1</code>.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example <code>arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1</code>.</p> </li>  </ul>  <p>If you use <code>KmsKeyId</code>, you must set the <code>CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted</code> parameter to true.</p> <important>   <p>EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys with Amazon EFS file systems.</p>  </important>

The mode can be <code>bursting</code>, <code>provisioned</code>, or <code>elastic</code>. If you set <code>ThroughputMode</code> to <code>provisioned</code>, you must also set a value for <code>ProvisionedThroughputInMibps</code>. After you create the file system, you can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes, with certain time restrictions.

It specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to create the file system. Use the format <code>us-east-1a</code> to specify the Availability Zone. For more information about One Zone storage classes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html">Using EFS storage classes</a> in the <i>Amazon EFS User Guide</i>.</p> <note>   <p>One Zone storage classes are not available in all Availability Zones in Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is available.</p>  </note>

Set the value to <code>true</code> to enable automatic backups. If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone storage classes, automatic backups are enabled by default.

Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on creation by including a <code>"Key":"Name","Value":"{value}"</code> key-value pair. Each key must be unique.
