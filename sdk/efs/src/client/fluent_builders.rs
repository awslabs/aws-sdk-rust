/// <p>Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in the application's own directory and any subdirectories. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html">Mounting a file system using EFS access points</a>.</p> <note> 
/// <p>If multiple requests to create access points on the same file system are sent in quick succession, and the file system is near the limit of 1000 access points, you may experience a throttling response for these requests. This is to ensure that the file system does not exceed the stated access point limit.</p>

If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system.</p>

/// </ul> 
/// <p>After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a <code>MountTargetId</code> and an <code>IpAddress</code>. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation">How it Works: Implementation Overview</a>. </p> 
/// <p>Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets</p> </li> 
/// </ul> 
/// <p>If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:</p> 
/// <ul> 
/// <li> <p>If the request provides an <code>IpAddress</code>, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 <code>CreateNetworkInterface</code> call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>If the request provides <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet's VPC.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Assigns the description <code>Mount target <i>fsmt-id</i> for file system <i>fs-id</i> </code> where <code> <i>fsmt-id</i> </code> is the mount target ID, and <code> <i>fs-id</i> </code> is the <code>FileSystemId</code>.</p> </li> 
/// <li> <p>Sets the <code>requesterManaged</code> property of the network interface to <code>true</code>, and the <code>requesterId</code> value to <code>EFS</code>.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> <p>Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the <code>NetworkInterfaceId</code> field in the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and the <code>IpAddress</code> field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire <code>CreateMountTarget</code> operation fails.</p> </li> 
/// </ul> <note> 
/// <p>The <code>CreateMountTarget</code> call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still <code>creating</code>, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the <code>DescribeMountTargets</code> operation, which among other things returns the mount target state.</p> 
/// </note> 
/// <p>We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/efs/">Amazon EFS</a>. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system through that mount target. </p>
