/// This client allows ergonomic access to a `MagnolioAPIService_v20150201`-shaped service.
/// Each method corresponds to an endpoint defined in the service's Smithy model,
/// and the request and response shapes are auto-generated from that same model.
///
/// # Using a Client
///
/// Once you have a client set up, you can access the service's endpoints
/// by calling the appropriate method on [`Client`]. Each such method
/// returns a request builder for that endpoint, with methods for setting
/// the various fields of the request. Once your request is complete, use

/// you then have to `.await` to get the service's response.

    /// <li>
    /// <p>Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets</p>

    /// <p>Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.</p>

    /// <p>If the request provides an <code>IpAddress</code>, Amazon EFS assigns that IP
    /// address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the
    /// subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 <code>CreateNetworkInterface</code> call
    /// does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).</p>
    /// </li>
    /// <li>
    /// <p>If the request provides <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is
    /// associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security
    /// group for the subnet's VPC.</p>
    /// </li>
    /// <li>
    /// <p>Assigns the description <code>Mount target <i>fsmt-id</i> for
    /// file system <i>fs-id</i>
    /// </code> where <code>
    /// <i>fsmt-id</i>
    /// </code> is the mount target ID, and <code>
    /// <i>fs-id</i>
    /// </code> is the <code>FileSystemId</code>.</p>
    /// </li>
    /// <li>
    /// <p>Sets the <code>requesterManaged</code> property of the network interface to
    /// <code>true</code>, and the <code>requesterId</code> value to
    /// <code>EFS</code>.</p>
    /// </li>
    /// </ul>
    /// <p>Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network
    /// interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the
    /// <code>NetworkInterfaceId</code> field in the mount target's description to the

    /// interface creation fails, the entire <code>CreateMountTarget</code> operation
    /// fails.</p>
    /// </li>
    /// </ul>
    /// <note>
    /// <p>The <code>CreateMountTarget</code> call returns only after creating the network
    /// interface, but while the mount target state is still <code>creating</code>, you can check
    /// the mount target creation status by calling the <a>DescribeMountTargets</a> operation, which among other things returns the mount
    /// target state.</p>
    /// </note>
    /// <p>We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There
    /// are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target
