//! <fullname>Amazon Elastic File System</fullname>
//! <p>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for
//! use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and
//! remove files, so that your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For
//! more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">Amazon Elastic File System API Reference</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html">Amazon Elastic File System User Guide</a>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
