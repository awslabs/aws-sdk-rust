impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`StartActivityStream`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`resource_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::resource_arn) / [`set_resource_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::set_resource_arn): <p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB cluster, for example, <code>arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345667890:cluster:das-cluster</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`mode(ActivityStreamMode)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::mode) / [`set_mode(Option<ActivityStreamMode>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::set_mode): <p>Specifies the mode of the database activity stream. Database events such as a change or access generate an activity stream event. The database session can handle these events either synchronously or asynchronously.</p>
    ///   - [`kms_key_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::kms_key_id) / [`set_kms_key_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::set_kms_key_id): <p>The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encrypting messages in the database activity stream. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.</p>
    ///   - [`apply_immediately(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::apply_immediately) / [`set_apply_immediately(Option<bool>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::set_apply_immediately): <p>Specifies whether or not the database activity stream is to start as soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window for the database.</p>
    ///   - [`engine_native_audit_fields_included(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::engine_native_audit_fields_included) / [`set_engine_native_audit_fields_included(Option<bool>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::StartActivityStream::set_engine_native_audit_fields_included): <p>Specifies whether the database activity stream includes engine-native audit fields. This option only applies to an Oracle DB instance. By default, no engine-native audit fields are included.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`StartActivityStreamOutput`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`kms_key_id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::kms_key_id): <p>The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of messages in the database activity stream.</p>
    ///   - [`kinesis_stream_name(Option<String>)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::kinesis_stream_name): <p>The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to be used for the database activity stream.</p>
    ///   - [`status(Option<ActivityStreamStatus>)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::status): <p>The status of the database activity stream.</p>
    ///   - [`mode(Option<ActivityStreamMode>)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::mode): <p>The mode of the database activity stream.</p>
    ///   - [`apply_immediately(bool)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::apply_immediately): <p>Indicates whether or not the database activity stream will start as soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window for the database.</p>
    ///   - [`engine_native_audit_fields_included(Option<bool>)`](crate::output::StartActivityStreamOutput::engine_native_audit_fields_included): <p>Indicates whether engine-native audit fields are included in the database activity stream.</p>
