    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeBlueGreenDeployments`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments::into_paginator).

If this parameter is specified, information from only the specific blue/green deployment is returned. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.</p>  <p>Constraints:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>If supplied, must match an existing blue/green deployment identifier.</p> </li>  </ul>
    ///   - [`filters(Vec<Filter>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments::filters) / [`set_filters(Option<Vec<Filter>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments::set_filters): <p>A filter that specifies one or more blue/green deployments to describe.</p>  <p>Supported filters:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>blue-green-deployment-identifier</code> - Accepts system-generated identifiers for blue/green deployments. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified identifiers.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>blue-green-deployment-name</code> - Accepts user-supplied names for blue/green deployments. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified names.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>source</code> - Accepts source databases for a blue/green deployment. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified source databases.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>target</code> - Accepts target databases for a blue/green deployment. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified target databases.</p> </li>  </ul>
    ///   - [`marker(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments::marker) / [`set_marker(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeBlueGreenDeployments::set_marker): <p>An optional pagination token provided by a previous <code>DescribeBlueGreenDeployments</code> request.

If more records exist than the specified <code>MaxRecords</code> value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so you can retrieve the remaining results.</p>  <p>Default: 100</p>  <p>Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.</p>
