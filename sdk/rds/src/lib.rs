//! Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.
//!
//! Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.
//!
//! This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.
//!
//! __Amazon RDS API Reference__
//!   - For the alphabetical list of API actions, see [API Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html).
//!   - For the alphabetical list of data types, see [Data Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html).
//!   - For a list of common query parameters, see [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html).
//!   - For descriptions of the error codes, see [Common Errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).
//!
//! __Amazon RDS User Guide__
//!   - For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see [Available RDS Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces).
//!   - For more information about how to use the Query API, see [Using the Query API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Using_the_Query_API.html).
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-rds` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
//! aws-sdk-rds = "1.35.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_rds as rds;
//!
//! #[::tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), rds::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = aws_sdk_rds::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-rds/latest/aws_sdk_rds/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by Amazon Relational Database Service. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling Amazon Relational Database Service.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_rds::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific values that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = ::aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_rds::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`AddRoleToDBCluster`](crate::operation::add_role_to_db_cluster) operation has
/// a [`Client::add_role_to_db_cluster`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `send()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.add_role_to_db_cluster()
///     .db_cluster_identifier("example")
///     .send()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
/// # Waiters
///
/// This client provides `wait_until` methods behind the [`Waiters`](crate::client::Waiters) trait.
/// To use them, simply import the trait, and then call one of the `wait_until` methods. This will
/// return a waiter fluent builder that takes various parameters, which are documented on the builder
/// type. Once parameters have been provided, the `wait` method can be called to initiate waiting.
///
/// For example, if there was a `wait_until_thing` method, it could look like:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.wait_until_thing()
///     .thing_id("someId")
///     .wait(Duration::from_secs(120))
///     .await;
/// ```
