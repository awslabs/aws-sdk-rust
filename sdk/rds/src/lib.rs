//! <fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname>
//! <p></p>
//!
//! <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and
//! scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational
//! database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications
//! and businesses unique.</p>
//! <p>Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server,
//! Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools
//! you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS
//! automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS
//! is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
//! application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for
//! the resources you use.</p>
//! <p>This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface
//! you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might
//! require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this
//! reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot,
//! or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics
//! from the user guide.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/rds).
