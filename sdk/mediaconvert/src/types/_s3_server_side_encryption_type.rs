/// When writing a match expression against `S3ServerSideEncryptionType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let s3serversideencryptiontype = unimplemented!();
/// match s3serversideencryptiontype {
///     S3ServerSideEncryptionType::ServerSideEncryptionKms => { /* ... */ },
///     S3ServerSideEncryptionType::ServerSideEncryptionS3 => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `s3serversideencryptiontype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `S3ServerSideEncryptionType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `S3ServerSideEncryptionType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `S3ServerSideEncryptionType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `s3serversideencryptiontype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `S3ServerSideEncryptionType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify how you want your data keys managed. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your content. AWS also encrypts the data keys themselves, using a customer master key (CMK), and then stores the encrypted data keys alongside your encrypted content. Use this setting to specify which AWS service manages the CMK. For simplest set up, choose Amazon S3 (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want your master key to be managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). By default, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses the AWS managed customer master key (CMK) associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys. You can optionally choose to specify a different, customer managed CMK. Do so by specifying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key for the setting  KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).
