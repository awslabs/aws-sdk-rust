/// When writing a match expression against `AudioDurationCorrection`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let audiodurationcorrection = unimplemented!();
/// match audiodurationcorrection {
///     AudioDurationCorrection::Auto => { /* ... */ },
///     AudioDurationCorrection::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     AudioDurationCorrection::Frame => { /* ... */ },
///     AudioDurationCorrection::Track => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `audiodurationcorrection` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `AudioDurationCorrection::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `AudioDurationCorrection::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `AudioDurationCorrection::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `audiodurationcorrection` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `AudioDurationCorrection::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Apply audio timing corrections to help synchronize audio and video in your output. To apply timing corrections, your input must meet the following requirements: * Container: MP4, or MOV, with an accurate time-to-sample (STTS) table. * Audio track: AAC. Choose from the following audio timing correction settings: * Disabled (Default): Apply no correction. * Auto: Recommended for most inputs. MediaConvert analyzes the audio timing in your input and determines which correction setting to use, if needed. * Track: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a constant amount to align the audio track length with STTS duration. Track-level correction does not affect pitch, and is recommended for tonal audio content such as music. * Frame: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a variable amount to align audio frames with STTS timestamps. No corrections are made to already-aligned frames. Frame-level correction may affect the pitch of corrected frames, and is recommended for atonal audio content such as speech or percussion.
