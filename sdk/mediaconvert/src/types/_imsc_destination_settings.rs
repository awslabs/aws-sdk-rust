/// Settings related to IMSC captions. IMSC is a sidecar format that holds captions in a file that is separate from the video container. Set up sidecar captions in the same output group, but different output from your video. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/ttml-and-webvtt-output-captions.html. When you work directly in your JSON job specification, include this object and any required children when you set destinationType to IMSC.
