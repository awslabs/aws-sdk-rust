/// When writing a match expression against `H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let h264temporaladaptivequantization = unimplemented!();
/// match h264temporaladaptivequantization {
///     H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `h264temporaladaptivequantization` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `h264temporaladaptivequantization` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Only use this setting when you change the default value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults, excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value for H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into account where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to set H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you enable temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization). To manually enable or disable H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.
