/// When writing a match expression against `DvbddsHandling`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let dvbddshandling = unimplemented!();
/// match dvbddshandling {
///     DvbddsHandling::None => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbddsHandling::NoDisplayWindow => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbddsHandling::Specified => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dvbddshandling` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DvbddsHandling::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dvbddshandling` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify how MediaConvert handles the display definition segment (DDS). Keep the default, None (NONE), to exclude the DDS from this set of captions. Choose No display window (NO_DISPLAY_WINDOW) to have MediaConvert include the DDS but not include display window data. In this case, MediaConvert writes that information to the page composition segment (PCS) instead. Choose Specify (SPECIFIED) to have MediaConvert set up the display window based on the values that you specify in related job settings. For video resolutions that are 576 pixels or smaller in height, MediaConvert doesn't include the DDS, regardless of the value you choose for DDS handling (ddsHandling). In this case, it doesn't write the display window data to the PCS either. Related settings: Use the settings DDS x-coordinate (ddsXCoordinate) and DDS y-coordinate (ddsYCoordinate) to specify the offset between the top left corner of the display window and the top left corner of the video frame. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.
