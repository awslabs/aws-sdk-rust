/// When writing a match expression against `DvbddsHandling`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let dvbddshandling = unimplemented!();
/// match dvbddshandling {
///     DvbddsHandling::None => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbddsHandling::NoDisplayWindow => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbddsHandling::Specified => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbddsHandling::SpecifiedOptimal => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dvbddshandling` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DvbddsHandling::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dvbddshandling` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DvbddsHandling::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// Specify how MediaConvert handles the display definition segment (DDS). To exclude the DDS from this set of captions: Keep the default, None. To include the DDS: Choose Specified. When you do, also specify the offset coordinates of the display window with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate. To include the DDS, but not include display window data: Choose No display window. When you do, you can write position metadata to the page composition segment (PCS) with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate. For video resolutions with a height of 576 pixels or less, MediaConvert doesn't include the DDS, regardless of the value you choose for DDS handling. All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match. To include the DDS, with optimized subtitle placement and reduced data overhead: We recommend that you choose Specified (optimal). This option provides the same visual positioning as Specified while using less bandwidth. This also supports resolutions higher than 1080p while maintaining full DVB-Sub compatibility. When you do, also specify the offset coordinates of the display window with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate.
