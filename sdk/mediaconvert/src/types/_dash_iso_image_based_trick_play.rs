/// When writing a match expression against `DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let dashisoimagebasedtrickplay = unimplemented!();
/// match dashisoimagebasedtrickplay {
///     DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::Advanced => { /* ... */ },
///     DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::None => { /* ... */ },
///     DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::Thumbnail => { /* ... */ },
///     DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::ThumbnailAndFullframe => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dashisoimagebasedtrickplay` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dashisoimagebasedtrickplay` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlay::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify whether MediaConvert generates images for trick play. Keep the default value, None (NONE), to not generate any images. Choose Thumbnail (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled thumbnails. Choose Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to generate tiled thumbnails and full-resolution images of single frames. MediaConvert adds an entry in the .mpd manifest for each set of images that you generate. A common application for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumbnails and full-frame images that MediaConvert creates with this feature are compatible with this Roku specification: https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/media-playback/trick-mode/hls-and-dash.md
