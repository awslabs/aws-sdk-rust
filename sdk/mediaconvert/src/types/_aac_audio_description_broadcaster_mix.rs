/// When writing a match expression against `AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let aacaudiodescriptionbroadcastermix = unimplemented!();
/// match aacaudiodescriptionbroadcastermix {
///     AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::BroadcasterMixedAd => { /* ... */ },
///     AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::Normal => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `aacaudiodescriptionbroadcastermix` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `aacaudiodescriptionbroadcastermix` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `AacAudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input contains pre-mixed main audio + audio description (AD) as a stereo pair. The value for AudioType will be set to 3, which signals to downstream systems that this stream contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note that the input received by the encoder must contain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not perform the mixing. When you choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder ignores any values you provide in AudioType and FollowInputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the input does not contain pre-mixed audio + audio description (AD). In this case, the encoder will use any values you provide for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.
