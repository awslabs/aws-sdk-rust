/// When writing a match expression against `ColorSpaceUsage`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let colorspaceusage = unimplemented!();
/// match colorspaceusage {
///     ColorSpaceUsage::Fallback => { /* ... */ },
///     ColorSpaceUsage::Force => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `colorspaceusage` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `ColorSpaceUsage::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `ColorSpaceUsage::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `ColorSpaceUsage::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `colorspaceusage` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `ColorSpaceUsage::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// There are two sources for color metadata, the input file and the job input settings Color space and HDR master display information settings. The Color space usage setting determines which takes precedence. Choose Force to use color metadata from the input job settings. If you don't specify values for those settings, the service defaults to using metadata from your input. FALLBACK - Choose Fallback to use color metadata from the source when it is present. If there's no color metadata in your input file, the service defaults to using values you specify in the input settings.
