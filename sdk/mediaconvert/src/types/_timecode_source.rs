/// When writing a match expression against `TimecodeSource`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let timecodesource = unimplemented!();
/// match timecodesource {
///     TimecodeSource::Embedded => { /* ... */ },
///     TimecodeSource::Specifiedstart => { /* ... */ },
///     TimecodeSource::Zerobased => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `timecodesource` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `TimecodeSource::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `TimecodeSource::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `TimecodeSource::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `timecodesource` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `TimecodeSource::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Use Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are handled within this job. To make sure that your video, audio, captions, and markers are synchronized and that time-based features, such as image inserter, work correctly, choose the Timecode source option that matches your assets. All timecodes are in a 24-hour format with frame number (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED) - Use the timecode that is in the input video. If no embedded timecode is in the source, the service will use Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) - Set the timecode of the initial frame to a value other than zero. You use Start timecode (Start) to provide this value.
