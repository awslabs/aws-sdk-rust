The other options for this setting determine the values that MediaConvert writes for the DEFAULT and AUTOSELECT attributes of the EXT-X-MEDIA entry for the audio variant. For more information about these attributes, see the Apple documentation article https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist. Choose Alternate audio, auto select, default (ALTERNATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT_DEFAULT) to set DEFAULT=YES and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this value for only one variant in your output group. Choose Alternate audio, auto select, not default (ALTERNATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT) to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose Alternate Audio, Not Auto Select to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=NO. When you don't specify a value for this setting, MediaConvert defaults to Alternate audio, auto select, default. When there is more than one variant in your output group, you must explicitly choose a value for this setting.
