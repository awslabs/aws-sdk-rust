/// When writing a match expression against `WebvttAccessibilitySubs`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let webvttaccessibilitysubs = unimplemented!();
/// match webvttaccessibilitysubs {
///     WebvttAccessibilitySubs::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     WebvttAccessibilitySubs::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `webvttaccessibilitysubs` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `WebvttAccessibilitySubs::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `WebvttAccessibilitySubs::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `WebvttAccessibilitySubs::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `webvttaccessibilitysubs` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `WebvttAccessibilitySubs::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// If the WebVTT captions track is intended to provide accessibility for people who are deaf or hard of hearing: Set Accessibility subtitles to Enabled. When you do, MediaConvert adds accessibility attributes to your output HLS or DASH manifest. For HLS manifests, MediaConvert adds the following accessibility attributes under EXT-X-MEDIA for this track: CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.transcribes-spoken-dialog,public.accessibility.describes-music-and-sound" and AUTOSELECT="YES". For DASH manifests, MediaConvert adds the following in the adaptation set for this track: <Accessibility schemeIdUri="urn:mpeg:dash:role:2011" value="caption"/>. If the captions track is not intended to provide such accessibility: Keep the default value, Disabled. When you do, for DASH manifests, MediaConvert instead adds the following in the adaptation set for this track: <Role schemeIDUri="urn:mpeg:dash:role:2011" value="subtitle"/>.
