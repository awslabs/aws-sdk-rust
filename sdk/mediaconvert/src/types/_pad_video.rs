/// When writing a match expression against `PadVideo`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let padvideo = unimplemented!();
/// match padvideo {
///     PadVideo::Black => { /* ... */ },
///     PadVideo::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `padvideo` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `PadVideo::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `PadVideo::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `PadVideo::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `padvideo` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `PadVideo::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Use this setting if your input has video and audio durations that don't align, and your output or player has strict alignment requirements. Examples: Input audio track has a delayed start. Input video track ends before audio ends. When you set Pad video (padVideo) to Black (BLACK), MediaConvert generates black video frames so that output video and audio durations match. Black video frames are added at the beginning or end, depending on your input. To keep the default behavior and not generate black video, set Pad video to Disabled (DISABLED) or leave blank.
