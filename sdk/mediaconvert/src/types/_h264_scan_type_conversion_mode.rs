/// When writing a match expression against `H264ScanTypeConversionMode`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let h264scantypeconversionmode = unimplemented!();
/// match h264scantypeconversionmode {
///     H264ScanTypeConversionMode::Interlaced => { /* ... */ },
///     H264ScanTypeConversionMode::InterlacedOptimize => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `h264scantypeconversionmode` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `H264ScanTypeConversionMode::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `H264ScanTypeConversionMode::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `H264ScanTypeConversionMode::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `h264scantypeconversionmode` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `H264ScanTypeConversionMode::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each progressive frame from the input corresponds to an interlaced field in the output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for all other output frame rates. With basic interlacing, MediaConvert performs any frame rate conversion first and then interlaces the frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and you set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automatically falls back to basic interlacing. Required settings: To use optimized interlacing, you must set Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).
