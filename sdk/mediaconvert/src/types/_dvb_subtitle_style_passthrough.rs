/// When writing a match expression against `DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let dvbsubtitlestylepassthrough = unimplemented!();
/// match dvbsubtitlestylepassthrough {
///     DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dvbsubtitlestylepassthrough` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dvbsubtitlestylepassthrough` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DvbSubtitleStylePassthrough::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Set Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) to ENABLED to use the available style, color, and position information from your input captions. MediaConvert uses default settings for any missing style and position information in your input captions. Set Style passthrough to DISABLED, or leave blank, to ignore the style and position information from your input captions and use default settings: white text with black outlining, bottom-center positioning, and automatic sizing. Whether you set Style passthrough to enabled or not, you can also choose to manually override any of the individual style and position settings.
