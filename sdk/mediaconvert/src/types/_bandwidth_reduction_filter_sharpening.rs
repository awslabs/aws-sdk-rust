/// When writing a match expression against `BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let bandwidthreductionfiltersharpening = unimplemented!();
/// match bandwidthreductionfiltersharpening {
///     BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::High => { /* ... */ },
///     BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::Low => { /* ... */ },
///     BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::Medium => { /* ... */ },
///     BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::Off => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `bandwidthreductionfiltersharpening` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `bandwidthreductionfiltersharpening` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `BandwidthReductionFilterSharpening::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Optionally specify the level of sharpening to apply when you use the Bandwidth reduction filter. Sharpening adds contrast to the edges of your video content and can reduce softness. Keep the default value Off to apply no sharpening. Set Sharpening strength to Low to apply a minimal amount of sharpening, or High to apply a maximum amount of sharpening.
