/// When writing a match expression against `H265WriteMp4PackagingType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let h265writemp4packagingtype = unimplemented!();
/// match h265writemp4packagingtype {
///     H265WriteMp4PackagingType::Hev1 => { /* ... */ },
///     H265WriteMp4PackagingType::Hvc1 => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `h265writemp4packagingtype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `H265WriteMp4PackagingType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `H265WriteMp4PackagingType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `H265WriteMp4PackagingType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `h265writemp4packagingtype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `H265WriteMp4PackagingType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// If the location of parameter set NAL units doesn't matter in your workflow, ignore this setting. Use this setting only with CMAF or DASH outputs, or with standalone file outputs in an MPEG-4 container (MP4 outputs). Choose HVC1 to mark your output as HVC1. This makes your output compliant with the following specification: ISO IECJTC1 SC29 N13798 Text ISO/IEC FDIS 14496-15 3rd Edition. For these outputs, the service stores parameter set NAL units in the sample headers but not in the samples directly. For MP4 outputs, when you choose HVC1, your output video might not work properly with some downstream systems and video players. The service defaults to marking your output as HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes parameter set NAL units directly into the samples.
