/// Use Dynamic audio selectors when you do not know the track layout of your source when you submit your job, but want to select multiple audio tracks. When you include an audio track in your output and specify this Dynamic audio selector as the Audio source, MediaConvert creates an output audio track for each dynamically selected track. Note that when you include a Dynamic audio selector for two or more inputs, each input must have the same number of audio tracks and audio channels.

MediaConvert analyzes the audio timing in your input and determines which correction setting to use, if needed. * Track: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a constant amount to align the audio track length with STTS duration.
