/// When writing a match expression against `H264SlowPal`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let h264slowpal = unimplemented!();
/// match h264slowpal {
///     H264SlowPal::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     H264SlowPal::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `h264slowpal` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `H264SlowPal::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `H264SlowPal::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `H264SlowPal::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `h264slowpal` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `H264SlowPal::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Required settings: You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON job specification, set (framerateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.
