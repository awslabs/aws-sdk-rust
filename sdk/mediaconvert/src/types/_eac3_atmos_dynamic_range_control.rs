/// When writing a match expression against `Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let eac3atmosdynamicrangecontrol = unimplemented!();
/// match eac3atmosdynamicrangecontrol {
///     Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::InitializeFromSource => { /* ... */ },
///     Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::Specified => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `eac3atmosdynamicrangecontrol` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `eac3atmosdynamicrangecontrol` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `Eac3AtmosDynamicRangeControl::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify whether MediaConvert should use any dynamic range control metadata from your input file. Keep the default value, Custom (SPECIFIED), to provide dynamic range control values in your job settings. Choose Follow source (INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE) to use the metadata from your input. Related settings--Use these settings to specify your dynamic range control values: Dynamic range compression line (DynamicRangeCompressionLine) and Dynamic range compression RF (DynamicRangeCompressionRf). When you keep the value Custom (SPECIFIED) for Dynamic range control (DynamicRangeControl) and you don't specify values for the related settings, MediaConvert uses default values for those settings.
