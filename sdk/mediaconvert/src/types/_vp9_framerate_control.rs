/// When writing a match expression against `Vp9FramerateControl`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let vp9frameratecontrol = unimplemented!();
/// match vp9frameratecontrol {
///     Vp9FramerateControl::InitializeFromSource => { /* ... */ },
///     Vp9FramerateControl::Specified => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `vp9frameratecontrol` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `Vp9FramerateControl::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `Vp9FramerateControl::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `Vp9FramerateControl::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `vp9frameratecontrol` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `Vp9FramerateControl::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// If you are using the console, use the Framerate setting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you want to keep the same frame rate as the input video, choose Follow source. If you want to do frame rate conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown list are decimal approximations of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating your transcoding job specification as a JSON file without the console, use FramerateControl to specify which value the service uses for the frame rate for this output. Choose INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you want the service to use the frame rate you specify in the settings FramerateNumerator and FramerateDenominator.
