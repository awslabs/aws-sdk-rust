/// When writing a match expression against `M3u8Scte35Source`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let m3u8scte35source = unimplemented!();
/// match m3u8scte35source {
///     M3u8Scte35Source::None => { /* ... */ },
///     M3u8Scte35Source::Passthrough => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `m3u8scte35source` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `M3u8Scte35Source::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `M3u8Scte35Source::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `M3u8Scte35Source::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `m3u8scte35source` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `M3u8Scte35Source::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// For SCTE-35 markers from your input-- Choose Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in your input to also appear in this output. Choose None (NONE) if you don't want SCTE-35 markers in this output. For SCTE-35 markers from an ESAM XML document-- Choose None (NONE) if you don't want manifest conditioning. Choose Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH) and choose Ad markers (adMarkers) if you do want manifest conditioning. In both cases, also provide the ESAM XML as a string in the setting Signal processing notification XML (sccXml).
