/// When writing a match expression against `FrameControl`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let framecontrol = unimplemented!();
/// match framecontrol {
///     FrameControl::NearestIdrframe => { /* ... */ },
///     FrameControl::NearestIframe => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `framecontrol` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `FrameControl::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `FrameControl::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `FrameControl::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `framecontrol` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `FrameControl::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// Choose how MediaConvert handles start and end times for input clipping with video passthrough. Your input video codec must be H.264 or H.265 to use IFRAME. To clip at the nearest IDR-frame: Choose Nearest IDR. If an IDR-frame is not found at the frame that you specify, MediaConvert uses the next compatible IDR-frame. Note that your output may be shorter than your input clip duration. To clip at the nearest I-frame: Choose Nearest I-frame. If an I-frame is not found at the frame that you specify, MediaConvert uses the next compatible I-frame. Note that your output may be shorter than your input clip duration. We only recommend this setting for special workflows, and when you choose this setting your output may not be compatible with most players.
