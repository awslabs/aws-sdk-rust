/// When writing a match expression against `DashIsoSegmentLengthControl`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let dashisosegmentlengthcontrol = unimplemented!();
/// match dashisosegmentlengthcontrol {
///     DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::Exact => { /* ... */ },
///     DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::GopMultiple => { /* ... */ },
///     DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::Match => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dashisosegmentlengthcontrol` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dashisosegmentlengthcontrol` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DashIsoSegmentLengthControl::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
///
/// Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine segment lengths in this output group. To use the exact value that you specify under Segment length: Choose Exact. Note that this might result in additional I-frames in the output GOP. To create segment lengths that are a multiple of the GOP: Choose Multiple of GOP. MediaConvert will round up the segment lengths to match the next GOP boundary. To have MediaConvert automatically determine a segment duration that is a multiple of both the audio packets and the frame rates: Choose Match. When you do, also specify a target segment duration under Segment length. This is useful for some ad-insertion or segment replacement workflows. Note that Match has the following requirements: - Output containers: Include at least one video output and at least one audio output. Audio-only outputs are not supported. - Output frame rate: Follow source is not supported. - Multiple output frame rates: When you specify multiple outputs, we recommend they share a similar frame rate (as in X/3, X/2, X, or 2X). For example: 5, 15, 30 and 60. Or: 25 and 50. (Outputs must share an integer multiple.) - Output audio codec: Specify Advanced Audio Coding (AAC). - Output sample rate: Choose 48kHz.
