/// When writing a match expression against `ProresChromaSampling`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let proreschromasampling = unimplemented!();
/// match proreschromasampling {
///     ProresChromaSampling::Preserve444Sampling => { /* ... */ },
///     ProresChromaSampling::SubsampleTo422 => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `proreschromasampling` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `ProresChromaSampling::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `ProresChromaSampling::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `ProresChromaSampling::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `proreschromasampling` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `ProresChromaSampling::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// This setting applies only to ProRes 4444 and ProRes 4444 XQ outputs that you create from inputs that use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Preserve 4:4:4 sampling (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING) to allow outputs to also use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. You must specify a value for this setting when your output codec profile supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Related Settings: When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING), you must choose an output codec profile that supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. These values for Profile (CodecProfile) support 4:4:4 chroma sampling: Apple ProRes 4444 (APPLE_PRORES_4444) or Apple ProRes 4444 XQ (APPLE_PRORES_4444_XQ). When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling, you must disable all video preprocessors except for Nexguard file marker (PartnerWatermarking). When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling and use framerate conversion, you must set Frame rate conversion algorithm (FramerateConversionAlgorithm) to Drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP).
