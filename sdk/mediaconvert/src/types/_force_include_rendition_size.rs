/// Use Force include renditions to specify one or more resolutions to include your ABR stack. * (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR, specify as few resolutions as possible. * (Required) The number of resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or less than, the Max renditions setting. * If you specify a Min top rendition size rule, specify at least one resolution that is equal to, or greater than, Min top rendition size. * If you specify a Min bottom rendition size rule, only specify resolutions that are equal to, or greater than, Min bottom rendition size. * If you specify a Force include renditions rule, do not specify a separate rule for Allowed renditions. * Note: The ABR stack may include other resolutions that you do not specify here, depending on the Max renditions setting.
