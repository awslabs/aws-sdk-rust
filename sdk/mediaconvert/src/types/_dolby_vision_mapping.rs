/// When writing a match expression against `DolbyVisionMapping`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let dolbyvisionmapping = unimplemented!();
/// match dolbyvisionmapping {
///     DolbyVisionMapping::Hdr101000 => { /* ... */ },
///     DolbyVisionMapping::Hdr10Nomap => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dolbyvisionmapping` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DolbyVisionMapping::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DolbyVisionMapping::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DolbyVisionMapping::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dolbyvisionmapping` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DolbyVisionMapping::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Required when you set Dolby Vision Profile to Profile 8.1. When you set Content mapping to None, content mapping is not applied to the HDR10-compatible signal. Depending on the source peak nit level, clipping might occur on HDR devices without Dolby Vision. When you set Content mapping to HDR10 1000, the transcoder creates a 1,000 nits peak HDR10-compatible signal by applying static content mapping to the source. This mode is speed-optimized for PQ10 sources with metadata that is created from analysis. For graded Dolby Vision content, be aware that creative intent might not be guaranteed with extreme 1,000 nits trims.
