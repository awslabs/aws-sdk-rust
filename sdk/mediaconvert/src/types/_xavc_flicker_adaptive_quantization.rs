/// When writing a match expression against `XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let xavcflickeradaptivequantization = unimplemented!();
/// match xavcflickeradaptivequantization {
///     XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `xavcflickeradaptivequantization` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `xavcflickeradaptivequantization` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `XavcFlickerAdaptiveQuantization::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting Adaptive quantization (XavcAdaptiveQuantization). When you do so, MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for your video content. Include this setting in your JSON job specification only when you choose to change the default value for Adaptive quantization. Enable this setting to have the encoder reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears as a visual flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits by copying some macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and then refreshes them at the I-frame. When you enable this setting, the encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more often to smooth out the flicker. This setting is disabled by default. Related setting: In addition to enabling this setting, you must also set Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization) to a value other than Off (OFF) or Auto (AUTO). Use Adaptive quantization to adjust the degree of smoothing that Flicker adaptive quantization provides.
