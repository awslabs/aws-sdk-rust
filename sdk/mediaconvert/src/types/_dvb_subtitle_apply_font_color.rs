/// When writing a match expression against `DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let dvbsubtitleapplyfontcolor = unimplemented!();
/// match dvbsubtitleapplyfontcolor {
///     DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::AllText => { /* ... */ },
///     DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::WhiteTextOnly => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `dvbsubtitleapplyfontcolor` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `dvbsubtitleapplyfontcolor` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DvbSubtitleApplyFontColor::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Ignore this setting unless Style Passthrough (StylePassthrough) is set to Enabled and Font color (FontColor) set to Black, Yellow, Red, Green, Blue, or Hex. Use Apply font color (ApplyFontColor) for additional font color controls. When you choose White text only (WHITE_TEXT_ONLY), or leave blank, your font color setting only applies to white text in your input captions. For example, if your font color setting is Yellow, and your input captions have red and white text, your output captions will have red and yellow text. When you choose ALL_TEXT, your font color setting applies to all of your output captions text.
