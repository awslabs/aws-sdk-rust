/// When writing a match expression against `HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let hlsprogressivewritehlsmanifest = unimplemented!();
/// match hlsprogressivewritehlsmanifest {
///     HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::Disabled => { /* ... */ },
///     HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::Enabled => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `hlsprogressivewritehlsmanifest` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `hlsprogressivewritehlsmanifest` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `HlsProgressiveWriteHlsManifest::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify whether MediaConvert generates HLS manifests while your job is running or when your job is complete. To generate HLS manifests while your job is running: Choose Enabled. Use if you want to play back your content as soon as it's available. MediaConvert writes the parent and child manifests after the first three media segments are written to your destination S3 bucket. It then writes new updated manifests after each additional segment is written. The parent manifest includes the latest BANDWIDTH and AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH attributes, and child manifests include the latest available media segment. When your job completes, the final child playlists include an EXT-X-ENDLIST tag. To generate HLS manifests only when your job completes: Choose Disabled.
