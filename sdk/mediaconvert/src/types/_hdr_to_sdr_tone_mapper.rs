/// When writing a match expression against `HdrToSdrToneMapper`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let hdrtosdrtonemapper = unimplemented!();
/// match hdrtosdrtonemapper {
///     HdrToSdrToneMapper::PreserveDetails => { /* ... */ },
///     HdrToSdrToneMapper::Vibrant => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `hdrtosdrtonemapper` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `HdrToSdrToneMapper::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `HdrToSdrToneMapper::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `HdrToSdrToneMapper::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `hdrtosdrtonemapper` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `HdrToSdrToneMapper::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// Specify how MediaConvert maps brightness and colors from your HDR input to your SDR output. The mode that you select represents a creative choice, with different tradeoffs in the details and tones of your output. To maintain details in bright or saturated areas of your output: Choose Preserve details. For some sources, your SDR output may look less bright and less saturated when compared to your HDR source. MediaConvert automatically applies this mode for HLG sources, regardless of your choice. For a bright and saturated output: Choose Vibrant. We recommend that you choose this mode when any of your source content is HDR10, and for the best results when it is mastered for 1000 nits. You may notice loss of details in bright or saturated areas of your output. HDR to SDR tone mapping has no effect when your input is SDR.
