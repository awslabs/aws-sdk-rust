# aws-sdk-ivs

__Introduction__

The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors.

The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the [Amazon IVS page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

_ __All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. __ _

For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see [Document History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html).

__Allowed Header Values__
  - __Accept:__ application/json
  - __Accept-Encoding:__ gzip, deflate
  - __Content-Type:__ application/json

__Key Concepts__
  - __Channel__ — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream.
  - __Stream key__ — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. _ __Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.__ _
  - __Playback key pair__ — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token.
  - __Recording configuration__ — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration.
  - __Playback restriction policy__ — Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites.

For more information about your IVS live stream, also see [Getting Started with IVS Low-Latency Streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/getting-started.html).

__Tagging__

A _tag_ is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a _key_ and a _value_, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See [Best practices and strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html) in _Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor_ for details, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.

Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see [Access Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html)).

The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related operations: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations.

At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.

__Authentication versus Authorization__

Note the differences between these concepts:
  - _Authentication_ is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.
  - _Authorization_ is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization is needed to view [Amazon IVS private channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html). (Private channels are channels that are enabled for "playback authorization.")

__Authentication__

All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.

You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from a user account that has the ivs:PutMetadata permission.

For more information:
  - Authentication and generating signatures — See [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.
  - Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See [Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) on the Security page of the _Amazon IVS User Guide_.

__Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)__

ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see [Amazon Resource Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the _AWS General Reference_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-ivs` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-ivs = "1.47.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_ivs as ivs;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), ivs::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_ivs::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-ivs/latest/aws_sdk_ivs/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
