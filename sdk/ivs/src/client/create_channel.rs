    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateChannel`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_name): <p>Channel name.</p>
    ///   - [`latency_mode(ChannelLatencyMode)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::latency_mode) / [`set_latency_mode(Option<ChannelLatencyMode>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_latency_mode): <p>Channel latency mode. Use <code>NORMAL</code> to broadcast and deliver live video up to Full HD. Use <code>LOW</code> for near-real-time interaction with viewers. (Note: In the Amazon IVS console, <code>LOW</code> and <code>NORMAL</code> correspond to Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.) Default: <code>LOW</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`r#type(ChannelType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::type) / [`set_type(Option<ChannelType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_type): <p>Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate. <i>If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream probably will disconnect immediately.</i> Default: <code>STANDARD</code>. Valid values:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p> <code>STANDARD</code>: Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are generated from the original input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network conditions. Transcoding allows higher playback quality across a range of download speeds. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only for renditions 360p and below; above that, audio is passed through. This is the default.</p> </li>   <li> <p> <code>BASIC</code>: Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers. The viewerâ€™s video-quality choice is limited to the original input. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions between 480p and 1080p.</p> </li>  </ul>
    ///   - [`authorized(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::authorized) / [`set_authorized(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_authorized): <p>Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization). Default: <code>false</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`recording_configuration_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::recording_configuration_arn) / [`set_recording_configuration_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_recording_configuration_arn): <p>Recording-configuration ARN. Default: "" (empty string, recording is disabled).</p>
    ///   - [`tags(HashMap<String, String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateChannel::set_tags): <p>Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form <code>string:string (key:value)</code>. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p>
