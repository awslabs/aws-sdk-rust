/// <p>Represents a finding or issue discovered during policy generation or validation. Findings provide insights about potential problems, recommendations, or validation results from policy analysis operations. Finding types include: VALID (policy is ready to use), INVALID (policy has validation errors that must be fixed), NOT_TRANSLATABLE (input couldn't be converted to policy), ALLOW_ALL (policy would allow all actions, potential security risk), ALLOW_NONE (policy would allow no actions, unusable), DENY_ALL (policy would deny all actions, may be too restrictive), and DENY_NONE (policy would deny no actions, ineffective). Review all findings before creating policies from generated assets to ensure they match your security requirements.</p>
