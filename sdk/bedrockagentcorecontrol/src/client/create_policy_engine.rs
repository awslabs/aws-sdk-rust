This helps administrators understand the policy engine's role in the overall governance strategy. Document which Gateway this engine will be associated with, what types of tools or workflows it governs, and the team or service responsible for maintaining it. Clear descriptions are essential when managing multiple policy engines across different services or environments.</p><br>
