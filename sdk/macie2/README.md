# aws-sdk-macie2

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such as PII and intellectual property, to provide you with insight into the data that your organization stores in AWS. Macie also provides an inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, which it continually monitors for you. If Macie detects sensitive data or potential data access issues, it generates detailed findings for you to review and act upon as necessary.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-macie2` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.9.0"
aws-sdk-macie2 = "0.9.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
