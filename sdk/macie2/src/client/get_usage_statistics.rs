If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie uses an AND operator to join the conditions.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetUsageStatistics::max_results) / [`set_max_results(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::GetUsageStatistics::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of items to include in each page of the response.</p>

Valid values are: MONTH_TO_DATE, for the current calendar month to date; and, PAST_30_DAYS, for the preceding 30 days. If you don't specify a value, Amazon Macie provides usage data for the preceding 30 days.</p>
