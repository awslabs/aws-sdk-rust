    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateFindingsFilter`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:

Valid values are: ARCHIVE, suppress (automatically archive) the findings; and, NOOP, don't perform any action on the findings.</p>
    ///   - [`client_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::client_token) / [`set_client_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::set_client_token): <p>A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.</p>
    ///   - [`description(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::description) / [`set_description(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::set_description): <p>A custom description of the filter. The description can contain as many as 512 characters.</p>  <p>We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in the description of a filter. Other users of your account might be able to see this description, depending on the actions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.</p>
    ///   - [`finding_criteria(FindingCriteria)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::finding_criteria) / [`set_finding_criteria(Option<FindingCriteria>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::set_finding_criteria): <p>The criteria to use to filter findings.</p>
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::set_name): <p>A custom name for the filter. The name must contain at least 3 characters and can contain as many as 64 characters.</p>  <p>We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in the name of a filter. Other users of your account might be able to see this name, depending on the actions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.</p>

This value also determines the order in which the filter is applied to findings, relative to other filters that are also applied to the findings.</p>
    ///   - [`tags(HashMap<String, String>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::tags) / [`set_tags(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::operation::create_findings_filter::builders::CreateFindingsFilterFluentBuilder::set_tags): <p>A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to associate with the filter.</p>  <p>A findings filter can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a tag key and an associated tag value. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters.</p>
