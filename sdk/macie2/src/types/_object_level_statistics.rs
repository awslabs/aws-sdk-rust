/// <p>Provides information about the total storage size (in bytes) or number of objects that Amazon Macie can't analyze in one or more S3 buckets. In a BucketMetadata or MatchingBucket object, this data is for a specific bucket. In a GetBucketStatisticsResponse object, this data is aggregated for all the buckets in the query results. If versioning is enabled for a bucket, storage size values are based on the size of the latest version of each applicable object in the bucket.</p>
