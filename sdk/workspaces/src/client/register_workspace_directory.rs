You cannot register a directory if it does not have a status of Active. If the directory does not have a status of Active, you will receive an InvalidResourceStateException error. If you have already registered the maximum number of directories that you can register with Amazon WorkSpaces, you will receive a ResourceLimitExceededException error. Deregister directories that you are not using for WorkSpaces, and try again.</p>

Make sure that the subnets are in supported Availability Zones. The subnets must also be in separate Availability Zones. If these conditions are not met, you will receive an OperationNotSupportedException error.</p>

If you have enabled this parameter and WorkDocs is not available in the Region, you will receive an OperationNotSupportedException error. Set <code>EnableWorkDocs</code> to disabled, and try again.</p>

To use Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images, this value must be set to <code>DEDICATED</code> and your Amazon Web Services account must be enabled for BYOL. If your account has not been enabled for BYOL, you will receive an InvalidParameterValuesException error.
