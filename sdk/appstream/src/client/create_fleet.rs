If they try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in <code>DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds</code> elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session.

If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity. </p>  </note>
