//! <p>This is the <i>Amazon AppStream 2.0 API Reference</i>. This documentation provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in AppStream 2.0. AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed, secure application streaming service that lets you stream desktop applications to users without rewriting applications. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources that are required to host and run your applications, scales automatically, and provides access to your users on demand. </p>
//! 
//! <note>
//! <p>You can call the AppStream 2.0 API operations by using an interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/access-api-cli-through-interface-vpc-endpoint.html">Access AppStream 2.0 API Operations and CLI Commands Through an Interface VPC Endpoint</a> in the <i>Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide</i>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
