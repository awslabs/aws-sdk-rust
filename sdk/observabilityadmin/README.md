# aws-sdk-observabilityadmin

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Admin to discover and understand the state of telemetry configuration in CloudWatch for your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. This simplifies the process of auditing your telemetry collection configurations across multiple resource types within your Amazon Web Services Organization or account. By providing a consolidated view, it allows you to easily review and manage telemetry settings, helping you ensure proper monitoring and data collection across your Amazon Web Services environment. For more information, see [Auditing CloudWatch telemetry conﬁgurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/telemetry-config-cloudwatch.html) in the CloudWatch User Guide.

For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [Identity and access management for Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.html) in the CloudWatch User Guide.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-observabilityadmin` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-observabilityadmin = "1.40.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_observabilityadmin as observabilityadmin;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), observabilityadmin::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_observabilityadmin::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-observabilityadmin/latest/aws_sdk_observabilityadmin/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
