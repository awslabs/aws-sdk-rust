//! <fullname>Directory Service</fullname>
//! <p>Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the
//! Amazon Web Services cloud, or connect your Amazon Web Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active
//! Directory. This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations, data types,
//! parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">Directory Service</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html">Directory Service
//! Administration Guide</a>.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
//! programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
//! provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services
//! services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
//! install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
//! Services</a>.</p>
//! </note>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
