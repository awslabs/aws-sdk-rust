If this member is null, all trust relationships that belong to the current account are returned.</p>  <p>An empty list results in an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> being thrown.</p>

This occurs if there are less than the requested number of items left to retrieve, or if the limitations of the operation have been exceeded.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeTrustsOutput::next_token): <p>If not null, more results are available. Pass this value for the <i>NextToken</i> parameter in a subsequent call to <code>DescribeTrusts</code> to retrieve the next set of items.</p>
