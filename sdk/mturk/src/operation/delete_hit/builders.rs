/// <p> You can only dispose of HITs that are in the <code>Reviewable</code> state, with all of their submitted assignments already either approved or rejected. If you call the DeleteHIT operation on a HIT that is not in the <code>Reviewable</code> state (for example, that has not expired, or still has active assignments), or on a HIT that is Reviewable but without all of its submitted assignments already approved or rejected, the service will return an error. </p> <note>
