/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `CreateHIT`.
/// 
/// <p>The <code>CreateHIT</code> operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. </p> 
/// <p> This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values to <code>CreateHIT</code>, a new HIT is created for you, with a new <code>HITTypeID</code>. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.</p> 
/// <p> An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the <code>CreateHITType</code> operation and then call the <code>CreateHITWithHITType</code> operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs. </p> 
/// <p>CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the <code>Question</code> parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a <code>HitLayoutId</code> and associated <code>HitLayoutParameters</code>. </p> <note> 
/// <p> If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/pricing">Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing</a>.</p>
