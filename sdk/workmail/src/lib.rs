//! <p>Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for
//! existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and
//! calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or other native iOS and Android email
//! applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control
//! both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
//! stored.</p>
//! <p>The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Listing and describing organizations</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Managing users</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Managing groups</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Managing resources</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not
//! only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management
//! users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a
//! role and allowing an IAM user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
//! administrative visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM
//! policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete
//! users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above,
//! as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
//! model.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
