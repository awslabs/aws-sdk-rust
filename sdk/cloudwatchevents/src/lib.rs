//! <p>Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon Web Services resources. When your
//! resources change state, they automatically send events to an event stream. You can create
//! rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You
//! can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure
//! rules to:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event
//! notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for
//! detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
//! volume.</p>
//! </li>
//! </ul>
//! <p>For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide">Amazon EventBridge User
//! Guide</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
