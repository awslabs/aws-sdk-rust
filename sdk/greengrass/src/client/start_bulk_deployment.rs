    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`StartBulkDeployment`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder) operation.

                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`amzn_client_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::amzn_client_token) / [`set_amzn_client_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::set_amzn_client_token): A client token used to correlate requests and responses.
    ///   - [`execution_role_arn(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::execution_role_arn) / [`set_execution_role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::set_execution_role_arn): The ARN of the execution role to associate with the bulk deployment operation. This IAM role must allow the ''greengrass:CreateDeployment'' action for all group versions that are listed in the input file. This IAM role must have access to the S3 bucket containing the input file.
    ///   - [`input_file_uri(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::input_file_uri) / [`set_input_file_uri(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::start_bulk_deployment::builders::StartBulkDeploymentFluentBuilder::set_input_file_uri): The URI of the input file contained in the S3 bucket. The execution role must have ''getObject'' permissions on this bucket to access the input file. The input file is a JSON-serialized, line delimited file with UTF-8 encoding that provides a list of group and version IDs and the deployment type. This file must be less than 100 MB. Currently, AWS IoT Greengrass supports only ''NewDeployment'' deployment types.
