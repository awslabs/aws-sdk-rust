# aws-sdk-chimesdkmessaging

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The Amazon Chime SDK Messaging APIs in this section allow software developers to send and receive messages in custom messaging applications. These APIs depend on the frameworks provided by the Amazon Chime SDK Identity APIs. For more information about the messaging APIs, see [Amazon Chime SDK messaging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Chime_SDK_Messaging)

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/sdk/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-chimesdkmessaging` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.0.23-alpha"
aws-sdk-chimesdkmessaging = "0.0.23-alpha"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
