In this example, <code>d-</code> is a fixed prefix, and <code>1234567890</code> is a randomly generated string that contains numbers and lower case letters.

This value is generated by the identity store service. It is returned in the API response if the total results are more than the size of one page. This token is also returned when it is used in the API request to search for the next page.</p>
