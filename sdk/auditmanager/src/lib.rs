//! <p>Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who
//! need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and
//! errors. </p>
//! <p>Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that
//! you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the
//! effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.</p>
//! <p>Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate
//! assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of
//! controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to
//! the requirements of the specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize
//! frameworks and controls to support internal audits with specific requirements. </p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
