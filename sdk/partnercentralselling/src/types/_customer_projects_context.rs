/// <p>The CustomerProjects structure in Engagements offers a flexible framework for managing customer-project relationships. It supports multiple customers per Engagement and multiple projects per customer, while also allowing for customers without projects and projects without specific customers.</p>
/// <p>All Engagement members have full visibility of customers and their associated projects, enabling the capture of relevant context even when project details are not fully defined. This structure also facilitates targeted invitations, allowing partners to focus on specific customers and their business problems when sending Engagement invitations.</p>
