__AWS Partner Central API for Selling Reference Guide__

This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Central API reference is designed to help [AWS Partners](http://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/) integrate Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems with AWS Partner Central. Partners can automate interactions with AWS Partner Central, which helps to ensure effective engagements in joint business activities.

The API provides standard AWS API functionality. Access it by either using API [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/partner-central/latest/selling-api/API_Operations.html) or by using an AWS SDK that's tailored to your programming language or platform. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/getting-started) and [Tools to Build on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/).

__Features offered by AWS Partner Central API__
  1. __Opportunity management:__ Manages coselling opportunities through API actions such as CreateOpportunity, UpdateOpportunity, ListOpportunities, GetOpportunity, and AssignOpportunity.
  1. __AWS referral management:__ Manages referrals shared by AWS using actions such as ListEngagementInvitations, GetEngagementInvitation, StartEngagementByAcceptingInvitation, and RejectEngagementInvitation.
  1. __Entity association:__ Associates related entities such as _AWS Products_, _Partner Solutions_, and _AWS Marketplace Private Offers_ with opportunities using the actions AssociateOpportunity, and DisassociateOpportunity.
  1. __View AWS opportunity details:__ Retrieves real-time summaries of AWS opportunities using the GetAWSOpportunitySummary action.
  1. __List solutions:__ Provides list APIs for listing partner offers using ListSolutions.
  1. __Event subscription:__ Subscribe to real-time opportunity updates through AWS EventBridge by using actions such as _Opportunity Created_, _Opportunity Updated_, _Engagement Invitation Accepted_, _Engagement Invitation Rejected_, and _Engagement Invitation Created_.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-partnercentralselling` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-partnercentralselling = "1.40.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_partnercentralselling as partnercentralselling;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), partnercentralselling::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_partnercentralselling::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-partnercentralselling/latest/aws_sdk_partnercentralselling/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
