    ///   - [`count(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::count) / [`set_count(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::set_count): Number of resources
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::set_name): Name for the new reservation
    ///   - [`offering_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::offering_id) / [`set_offering_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::set_offering_id): Offering to purchase, e.g. '87654321'
    ///   - [`renewal_settings(RenewalSettings)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::renewal_settings) / [`set_renewal_settings(Option<RenewalSettings>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::set_renewal_settings): Renewal settings for the reservation

    ///   - [`start(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::start) / [`set_start(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::PurchaseOffering::set_start): Requested reservation start time (UTC) in ISO-8601 format. The specified time must be between the first day of the current month and one year from now. If no value is given, the default is now.
