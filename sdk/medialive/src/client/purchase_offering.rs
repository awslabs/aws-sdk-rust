    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`PurchaseOffering`](crate::operation::purchase_offering::builders::PurchaseOfferingFluentBuilder) operation.

    ///   - [`count(i32)`](crate::operation::purchase_offering::builders::PurchaseOfferingFluentBuilder::count) / [`set_count(i32)`](crate::operation::purchase_offering::builders::PurchaseOfferingFluentBuilder::set_count): Number of resources

The specified time must be between the first day of the current month and one year from now. If no value is given, the default is now.
