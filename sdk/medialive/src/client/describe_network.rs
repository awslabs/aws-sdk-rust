MediaLive Anywhere uses these IP addresses for Push inputs (in both Bridge and NAT networks) and for output destinations (only in Bridge networks). Each IpPool specifies one CIDR block.
    ///   - [`name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::describe_network::DescribeNetworkOutput::name): The name that you specified for the Network.
    ///   - [`routes(Option<Vec::<Route>>)`](crate::operation::describe_network::DescribeNetworkOutput::routes): An array of routes that MediaLive Anywhere needs to know about in order to route encoding traffic.
    ///   - [`state(Option<NetworkState>)`](crate::operation::describe_network::DescribeNetworkOutput::state): The current state of the Network. Only MediaLive Anywhere can change the state.
    /// - On failure, responds with [`SdkError<DescribeNetworkError>`](crate::operation::describe_network::DescribeNetworkError)
