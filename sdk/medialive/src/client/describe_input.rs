impl super::Client {
    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeInput`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeInput) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`input_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeInput::input_id) / [`set_input_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeInput::set_input_id): Unique ID of the input
    /// - On success, responds with [`DescribeInputOutput`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`arn(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::arn): The Unique ARN of the input (generated, immutable).
    ///   - [`attached_channels(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::attached_channels): A list of channel IDs that that input is attached to (currently an input can only be attached to one channel).
    ///   - [`destinations(Option<Vec<InputDestination>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::destinations): A list of the destinations of the input (PUSH-type).
    ///   - [`id(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::id): The generated ID of the input (unique for user account, immutable).
    ///   - [`input_class(Option<InputClass>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::input_class): STANDARD - MediaLive expects two sources to be connected to this input. If the channel is also STANDARD, both sources will be ingested. If the channel is SINGLE_PIPELINE, only the first source will be ingested; the second source will always be ignored, even if the first source fails. SINGLE_PIPELINE - You can connect only one source to this input. If the ChannelClass is also SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value is not valid because the channel requires two sources in the input.
    ///   - [`input_devices(Option<Vec<InputDeviceSettings>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::input_devices): Settings for the input devices.
    ///   - [`input_partner_ids(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::input_partner_ids): A list of IDs for all Inputs which are partners of this one.
    ///   - [`input_source_type(Option<InputSourceType>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::input_source_type): Certain pull input sources can be dynamic, meaning that they can have their URL's dynamically changes during input switch actions. Presently, this functionality only works with MP4_FILE and TS_FILE inputs.
    ///   - [`media_connect_flows(Option<Vec<MediaConnectFlow>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::media_connect_flows): A list of MediaConnect Flows for this input.
    ///   - [`name(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::name): The user-assigned name (This is a mutable value).
    ///   - [`role_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::role_arn): The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role this input assumes during and after creation.
    ///   - [`security_groups(Option<Vec<String>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::security_groups): A list of IDs for all the Input Security Groups attached to the input.
    ///   - [`sources(Option<Vec<InputSource>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::sources): A list of the sources of the input (PULL-type).
    ///   - [`state(Option<InputState>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::state): Placeholder documentation for InputState
    ///   - [`tags(Option<HashMap<String, String>>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::tags): A collection of key-value pairs.
    ///   - [`r#type(Option<InputType>)`](crate::output::DescribeInputOutput::type): The different types of inputs that AWS Elemental MediaLive supports.
    /// - On failure, responds with [`SdkError<DescribeInputError>`](crate::error::DescribeInputError)
