    ///   - [`channel_placement_groups(Option<Vec::<String>>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::channel_placement_groups): An array of IDs. Each ID is one ChannelPlacementGroup that is associated with this Node. Empty if the Node is not yet associated with any groups.
    ///   - [`cluster_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::cluster_id): The ID of the Cluster that the Node belongs to.
    ///   - [`connection_state(Option<NodeConnectionState>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::connection_state): The current connection state of the Node.
    ///   - [`id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::id): The unique ID of the Node. Unique in the Cluster. The ID is the resource-id portion of the ARN.
    ///   - [`instance_arn(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::instance_arn): The ARN of the EC2 instance hosting the Node.
    ///   - [`name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::name): The name that you specified for the Node.
    ///   - [`node_interface_mappings(Option<Vec::<NodeInterfaceMapping>>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::node_interface_mappings): Documentation update needed
    ///   - [`role(Option<NodeRole>)`](crate::operation::delete_node::DeleteNodeOutput::role): The initial role current role of the Node in the Cluster. ACTIVE means the Node is available for encoding. BACKUP means the Node is a redundant Node and might get used if an ACTIVE Node fails.
