                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`allocation_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::allocation_id) / [`set_allocation_id(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::set_allocation_id): <p>[EC2-VPC] The allocation ID. This is required for EC2-VPC.</p>

The instance must have exactly one attached network interface. For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both. For EC2-Classic, you must specify an instance ID and the instance must be in the running state.</p>
    ///   - [`public_ip(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::public_ip) / [`set_public_ip(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::set_public_ip): <p>[EC2-Classic] The Elastic IP address to associate with the instance.

Otherwise, the operation fails. In a VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account, reassociation is automatic, therefore you can specify false to ensure the operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with another resource.</p>
    ///   - [`dry_run(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::dry_run) / [`set_dry_run(Option<bool>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AssociateAddress::set_dry_run): <p>Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is <code>DryRunOperation</code>. Otherwise, it is <code>UnauthorizedOperation</code>.</p>

If the instance has more than one network interface, you must specify a network interface ID.</p>  <p>For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both. </p>
