    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`AllocateAddress`](crate::operation::allocate_address::builders::AllocateAddressFluentBuilder) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`domain(DomainType)`](crate::operation::allocate_address::builders::AllocateAddressFluentBuilder::domain) / [`set_domain(Option<DomainType>)`](crate::operation::allocate_address::builders::AllocateAddressFluentBuilder::set_domain): <p>Indicates whether the Elastic IP address is for use with instances in a VPC or instances in EC2-Classic.</p>  <p>Default: If the Region supports EC2-Classic, the default is <code>standard</code>. Otherwise, the default is <code>vpc</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`address(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::allocate_address::builders::AllocateAddressFluentBuilder::address) / [`set_address(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::allocate_address::builders::AllocateAddressFluentBuilder::set_address): <p>[EC2-VPC] The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address from an address pool.</p>

Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool. To specify a specific address from the address pool, use the <code>Address</code> parameter instead.</p>

Use this parameter to limit the IP address to this location. IP addresses cannot move between network border groups.</p>  <p>Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html">DescribeAvailabilityZones</a> to view the network border groups.</p>  <p>You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic. If you attempt this operation on EC2 Classic, you receive an <code>InvalidParameterCombination</code> error.</p>

Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool. Alternatively, specify a specific address from the address pool.</p>

If you have the required permissions, the error response is <code>DryRunOperation</code>. Otherwise, it is <code>UnauthorizedOperation</code>.</p>
