Otherwise, the default is <code>vpc</code>.</p>
    ///   - [`address(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AllocateAddress::address) / [`set_address(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AllocateAddress::set_address): <p>[EC2-VPC] The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address from an address pool.</p>

Use this parameter to limit the IP address to this location. IP addresses cannot move between network border groups.</p>  <p>Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html">DescribeAvailabilityZones</a> to view the network border groups.</p>  <p>You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic.

Use this parameter to let Amazon EC2 select an address from the address pool. Alternatively, specify a specific address from the address pool.</p>
    ///   - [`dry_run(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AllocateAddress::dry_run) / [`set_dry_run(Option<bool>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::AllocateAddress::set_dry_run): <p>Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
