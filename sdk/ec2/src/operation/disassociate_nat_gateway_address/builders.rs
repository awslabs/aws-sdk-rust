/// <p>While disassociating is in progress, you cannot associate/disassociate additional EIPs while the connections are being drained. You are, however, allowed to delete the NAT gateway.</p>

The EIPs stay associated and support the existing connections but do not support any new connections (new connections are distributed across the remaining associated EIPs). As the existing connections drain out, the EIPs (and the corresponding private IPs mapped to them) get released.</p>
