//! <p>Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help users
//! mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon Web Services-hosted applications.
//! An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services. </p>
//! <p>Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
//! highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to get
//! services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the
//! time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans
//! and enables responder team escalation. </p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
