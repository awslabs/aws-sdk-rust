//! <fullname>Step Functions</fullname>
//! <p>Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications
//! and microservices using visual workflows.</p>
//! <p>You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs
//! a discrete function, or <i>task</i>, allowing you to scale and change
//! applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your
//! application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and
//! retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right
//! order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any
//! issues.</p>
//! <p>Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is
//! available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own servers, or any system that has
//! access to Amazon Web Services. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or an HTTP API.
//! For more information about Step Functions, see the <i>
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html">Step Functions Developer Guide</a>
//! </i>.</p>
//!
//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
