/// <p>Restarts unsuccessful executions of Standard workflows that didn't complete successfully in the last 14 days. These include failed, aborted, or timed out executions. When you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-executions.html">redrive</a> an execution, it continues the failed execution from the unsuccessful step and uses the same input. Step Functions preserves the results and execution history of the successful steps, and doesn't rerun these steps when you redrive an execution. Redriven executions use the same state machine definition and execution ARN as the original execution attempt.</p>

The parent workflow redrives all the unsuccessful states, including a failed Map Run. If a Map Run was not started in the original execution attempt, the redriven parent workflow starts the Map Run.</p><note>
/// <p>This API action is not supported by <code>EXPRESS</code> state machines.</p>
/// <p>However, you can restart the unsuccessful executions of Express child workflows in a Distributed Map by redriving its Map Run. When you redrive a Map Run, the Express child workflows are rerun using the <code>StartExecution</code> API action.

/// <li>
/// <p>The execution status isn't <code>SUCCEEDED</code>.</p></li>

/// <p>Your workflow execution has not exceeded the redrivable period of 14 days. Redrivable period refers to the time during which you can redrive a given execution. This period starts from the day a state machine completes its execution.</p></li>
