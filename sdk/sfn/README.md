# aws-sdk-sfn

Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.

You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete function, or _task_, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any issues.

Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the _ [Step Functions Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) _.

If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action startSyncExecution and specify its parameter as StateMachineArn.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-sfn` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.4", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-sfn = "1.12.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_sfn as sfn;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), sfn::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_sfn::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-sfn/latest/aws_sdk_sfn/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
