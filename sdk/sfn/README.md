# aws-sdk-sfn

With Step Functions, you can create workflows, also called _state machines_, to build distributed applications, automate processes, orchestrate microservices, and create data and machine learning pipelines.

Through the Step Functions API, you can create, list, update, and delete state machines, activities, and other data types. You can start, stop, and redrive your state machines. Your activity workers can send task success, heartbeat, and failure responses.

With API calls, you can also manage other aspects of your workflow, such as tags, versions, and aliases.

For more information about developing solutions with Step Functions, see the _ [Step Functions Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) _.

If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal case. For example, you might use Step Functions API action startSyncExecution and specify its parameter as StateMachineArn.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-sfn` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-sfn = "1.90.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_sfn as sfn;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), sfn::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_sfn::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-sfn/latest/aws_sdk_sfn/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
