//! <p>Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the
//! File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH)
//! File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
//! S3). Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services Transfer Family by
//! integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route
//! 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data
//! in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine learning,
//! and archiving. Getting started with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family is easy since there is no
//! infrastructure to buy and set up.</p>
