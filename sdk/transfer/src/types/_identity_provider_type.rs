/// When writing a match expression against `IdentityProviderType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
///
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
///
/// ```text
/// # let identityprovidertype = unimplemented!();
/// match identityprovidertype {
///     IdentityProviderType::ApiGateway => { /* ... */ },
///     IdentityProviderType::AwsDirectoryService => { /* ... */ },
///     IdentityProviderType::AwsLambda => { /* ... */ },
///     IdentityProviderType::ServiceManaged => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `identityprovidertype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `IdentityProviderType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `IdentityProviderType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `IdentityProviderType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `identityprovidertype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `IdentityProviderType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
///
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
/// <p>The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is
/// <code>SERVICE_MANAGED</code>, which allows you to store and access user credentials within
/// the Transfer Family service.</p>
/// <p>Use <code>AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE</code> to provide access to
/// Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your
/// on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to
/// provide a Directory ID by using the <code>IdentityProviderDetails</code> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Use the <code>API_GATEWAY</code> value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The
/// <code>API_GATEWAY</code> setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call
/// for authentication by using the <code>IdentityProviderDetails</code> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Use the <code>AWS_LAMBDA</code> value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider.
/// If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the <code>Function</code> parameter
/// for the <code>IdentityProviderDetails</code> data type.</p>
