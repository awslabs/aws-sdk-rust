    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`DescribeVoices`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices) operation.

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`engine(Engine)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::engine) / [`set_engine(Option<Engine>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::set_engine): <p>Specifies the engine (<code>standard</code> or <code>neural</code>) used by Amazon Polly when processing input text for speech synthesis. </p>
    ///   - [`language_code(LanguageCode)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::language_code) / [`set_language_code(Option<LanguageCode>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::set_language_code): <p> The language identification tag (ISO 639 code for the language name-ISO 3166 country code) for filtering the list of voices returned. If you don't specify this optional parameter, all available voices are returned. </p>
    ///   - [`include_additional_language_codes(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::include_additional_language_codes) / [`set_include_additional_language_codes(bool)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::DescribeVoices::set_include_additional_language_codes): <p>Boolean value indicating whether to return any bilingual voices that use the specified language as an additional language. For instance, if you request all languages that use US English (es-US), and there is an Italian voice that speaks both Italian (it-IT) and US English, that voice will be included if you specify <code>yes</code> but not if you specify <code>no</code>.</p>

If present, this indicates where to continue the listing.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`DescribeVoicesOutput`](crate::output::DescribeVoicesOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`voices(Option<Vec<Voice>>)`](crate::output::DescribeVoicesOutput::voices): <p>A list of voices with their properties.</p>
    ///   - [`next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::output::DescribeVoicesOutput::next_token): <p>The pagination token to use in the next request to continue the listing of voices. <code>NextToken</code> is returned only if the response is truncated.</p>
