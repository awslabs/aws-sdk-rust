/// <p>Set the state of the routing control to reroute traffic. You can set the value to ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell. When the state is OFF, traffic does not flow.</p>
/// <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards for routing control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing control safeguards that are enforced with safety rules that you've configured. For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over your application.</p>
/// <p>The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property enables you override one or more safety rules and update routing control states.

/// <p><i>You must specify Regional endpoints when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i></p>
