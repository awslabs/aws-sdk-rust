//! <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p>
//! <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to
//! recover applications by rerouting traffic across
//! Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted
//! on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you
//! can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set
//! one routing control On and another one Off, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region
//! to another. </p>
//! <p>
//! <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations
//! to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
//! for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands.
//! For more information, see
//! <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
//! Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p>
//! <p>This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states
//! in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control
//! panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p>
//! <p>For more information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p>

//! <p>Learn about the components in recovery control, including clusters,

//! <p>Route 53 ARC also provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your
//! applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
