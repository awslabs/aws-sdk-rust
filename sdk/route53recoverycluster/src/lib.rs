//! <p>Welcome to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller API Reference Guide for Recovery Control Data Plane .</p>
//! <p>Recovery control in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller includes extremely reliable routing controls that enable you to recover applications
//! by rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability Zones or AWS Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches
//! hosted on a cluster. A cluster is a set of five redundant regional endpoints against which you can execute API calls to update or
//! get the state of routing controls. You use routing controls to failover traffic to recover your application
//! across Availability Zones or Regions.</p>
//! <p>This API guide includes information about how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p>
//! <p>For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, see the following:</p>
//! <ul>
//! <li>
//! <p>You can create clusters, routing controls, and control panels by using the control plane API for Recovery
//! Control. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery Control API Reference</a>.</p>
//! </li>
//! <li>
//! <p>Route 53 Application Recovery Controller also provides continuous readiness checks to ensure that your applications are scaled to handle failover traffic.
//! For more information about the related API actions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery Readiness API Reference</a>.</p>
