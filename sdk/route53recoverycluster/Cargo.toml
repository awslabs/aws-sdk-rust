description = "<p>Welcome to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller API Reference Guide for Recovery Control Data Plane .</p>\n\t\t\t      <p>Recovery control in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller includes extremely reliable routing controls that enable you to recover applications \n\t\t\t\tby rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability Zones or AWS Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches \n\t\t\t\thosted on a cluster. A cluster is a set of five redundant regional endpoints against which you can execute API calls to update or \n\t\t\t\tget the state of routing controls. You use routing controls to failover traffic to recover your application \n\t\t\t\tacross Availability Zones or Regions.</p>\n\t\t\t      <p>This API guide includes information about how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p>\n\t\t\t      <p>For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, see the following:</p>\n\t\t\t      <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>You can create clusters, routing controls, and control panels by using the control plane API for Recovery\n\t\t\t\t\tControl. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/\">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery Control API Reference</a>.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Route 53 Application Recovery Controller also provides continuous readiness checks to ensure that your applications are scaled to handle failover traffic. \n\t\t\t\t\tFor more information about the related API actions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-readiness/latest/api/\">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery Readiness API Reference</a>.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>For more information about creating resilient applications and preparing for recovery readiness with Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, \n\t\t\t\t\tsee the <a href=\"r53recovery/latest/dg/\">Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide</a>.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>"
