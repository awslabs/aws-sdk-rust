    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateAppMonitor`](crate::operation::create_app_monitor::builders::CreateAppMonitorFluentBuilder) operation.

                            /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::create_app_monitor::builders::CreateAppMonitorFluentBuilder::name) / [`set_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::create_app_monitor::builders::CreateAppMonitorFluentBuilder::set_name): <p>A name for the app monitor.</p>

You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.</p>  <p>Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.</p>  <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with an app monitor.</p>  <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services resources</a>.</p>

If you are using Amazon Cognito for authorization, you must include this structure in your request, and it must include the ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool to use for authorization. If you don't include <code>AppMonitorConfiguration</code>, you must set up your own authorization method. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-get-started-authorization.html">Authorize your application to send data to Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>  <p>If you omit this argument, the sample rate used for RUM is set to 10% of the user sessions.</p>

This parameter specifies whether RUM sends a copy of this telemetry data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in your account. This enables you to keep the telemetry data for more than 30 days, but it does incur Amazon CloudWatch Logs charges.</p>  <p>If you omit this parameter, the default is <code>false</code>.</p>

If you omit this parameter, custom events are <code>DISABLED</code>.</p>  <p>For more information about custom events, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-custom-events.html">Send custom events</a>.</p>
