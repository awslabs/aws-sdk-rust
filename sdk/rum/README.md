# aws-sdk-rum

With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect client-side data about your web application performance from actual user sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers use.

You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-rum` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-rum = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_rum as rum;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), rum::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_rum::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-rum/latest/aws_sdk_rum/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
