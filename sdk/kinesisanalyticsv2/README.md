# aws-sdk-kinesisanalyticsv2

Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink is a fully managed service that you can use to process and analyze streaming data using Java, Python, SQL, or Scala. The service enables you to quickly author and run Java, SQL, or Scala code against streaming sources to perform time series analytics, feed real-time dashboards, and create real-time metrics.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-kinesisanalyticsv2` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-kinesisanalyticsv2 = "1.17.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_kinesisanalyticsv2 as kinesisanalyticsv2;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), kinesisanalyticsv2::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_kinesisanalyticsv2::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-kinesisanalyticsv2/latest/aws_sdk_kinesisanalyticsv2/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
