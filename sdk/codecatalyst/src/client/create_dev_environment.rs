    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`CreateDevEnvironment`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment) operation.

    ///   - [`project_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::project_name) / [`set_project_name(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_project_name): <p>The name of the project in the space.</p>
    ///   - [`repositories(Vec<RepositoryInput>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::repositories) / [`set_repositories(Option<Vec<RepositoryInput>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_repositories): <p>The source repository that contains the branch to clone into the Dev Environment. </p>

Idempotency ensures that an API request completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, the subsequent retries return the result from the original successful request and have no additional effect.</p>
    ///   - [`alias(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::alias) / [`set_alias(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_alias): <p>The user-defined alias for a Dev Environment.</p>

For Dev Environment creation, this field contains configuration information and must be provided.</p>  </note>
    ///   - [`instance_type(InstanceType)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::instance_type) / [`set_instance_type(Option<InstanceType>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_instance_type): <p>The Amazon EC2 instace type to use for the Dev Environment. </p>
    ///   - [`inactivity_timeout_minutes(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::inactivity_timeout_minutes) / [`set_inactivity_timeout_minutes(i32)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_inactivity_timeout_minutes): <p>The amount of time the Dev Environment will run without any activity detected before stopping, in minutes. Only whole integers are allowed. Dev Environments consume compute minutes when running.</p>
    ///   - [`persistent_storage(PersistentStorageConfiguration)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::persistent_storage) / [`set_persistent_storage(Option<PersistentStorageConfiguration>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateDevEnvironment::set_persistent_storage): <p>Information about the amount of storage allocated to the Dev Environment. By default, a Dev Environment is configured to have 16GB of persistent storage.</p> <note>   <p>Valid values for persistent storage are based on memory sizes in 16GB increments. Valid values are 16, 32, and 64.</p>  </note>
