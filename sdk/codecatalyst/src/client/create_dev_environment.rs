Idempotency ensures that an API request completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, the subsequent retries return the result from the original successful request and have no additional effect.</p>

For Dev Environment creation, this field contains configuration information and must be provided.</p>  </note>

Only whole integers are allowed. Dev Environments consume compute minutes when running.</p>
