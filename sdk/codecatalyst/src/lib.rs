//! **Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
//! feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**
//!
//! Welcome to the Amazon CodeCatalyst API reference. This reference provides descriptions of operations and data types for Amazon CodeCatalyst. You can use the Amazon CodeCatalyst API to work with the following objects.
//!
//! Dev Environments and the Amazon Web Services Toolkits, by calling the following:
//!   - CreateAccessToken, which creates a personal access token (PAT) for the current user.
//!   - CreateDevEnvironment, which creates a Dev Environment, where you can quickly work on the code stored in the source repositories of your project.
//!   - CreateProject which creates a project in a specified space.
//!   - CreateSourceRepositoryBranch, which creates a branch in a specified repository where you can work on code.
//!   - DeleteDevEnvironment, which deletes a Dev Environment.
//!   - GetDevEnvironment, which returns information about a Dev Environment.
//!   - GetProject, which returns information about a project.
//!   - GetSourceRepositoryCloneUrls, which returns information about the URLs that can be used with a Git client to clone a source repository.
//!   - GetSubscription, which returns information about the Amazon Web Services account used for billing purposes and the billing plan for the space.
//!   - GetUserDetails, which returns information about a user in Amazon CodeCatalyst.
//!   - ListDevEnvironments, which retrives a list of Dev Environments in a project.
//!   - ListProjects, which retrieves a list of projects in a space.
//!   - ListSourceRepositories, which retrieves a list of source repositories in a project.
//!   - ListSourceRepositoryBranches, which retrieves a list of branches in a source repository.
//!   - ListSpaces, which retrieves a list of spaces.
//!   - StartDevEnvironment, which starts a specified Dev Environment and puts it into an active state.
//!   - StartDevEnvironmentSession, which starts a session to a specified Dev Environment.
//!   - StopDevEnvironment, which stops a specified Dev Environment and puts it into an stopped state.
//!   - UpdateDevEnvironment, which changes one or more values for a Dev Environment.
//!   - VerifySession, which verifies whether the calling user has a valid Amazon CodeCatalyst login and session.
//!
//! Security, activity, and resource management in Amazon CodeCatalyst, by calling the following:
//!   - DeleteAccessToken, which deletes a specified personal access token (PAT).
//!   - ListAccessTokens, which lists all personal access tokens (PATs) associated with a user.
//!   - ListEventLogs, which retrieves a list of events that occurred during a specified time period in a space.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! > Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
//! > [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).
//!
//! The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
//! as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-codecatalyst` to
//! your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! aws-config = "0.55.0"
//! aws-sdk-codecatalyst = "0.3.0"
//! tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then in code, a client can be created with the following:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use aws_sdk_codecatalyst as codecatalyst;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), codecatalyst::Error> {
//!     let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
//!     let client = codecatalyst::Client::new(&config);
//!
//!     // ... make some calls with the client
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-codecatalyst/latest/aws_sdk_codecatalyst/client/struct.Client.html)
//! for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.
//!
//! ## Using the SDK
//!
//! Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
//! [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
//! additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
//! offered by Amazon CodeCatalyst. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
//! where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
//! followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
//! either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).
//!
//! Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
//! These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
//! representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).
//!
//! All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
//! in [`config`](crate::config).
//!
//! The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
//! is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.
//!
//! There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
//! client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
//! [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

/// Client for calling Amazon CodeCatalyst.
/// ## Constructing a `Client`
///
/// A [`Config`] is required to construct a client. For most use cases, the [`aws-config`]
/// crate should be used to automatically resolve this config using
/// [`aws_config::load_from_env()`], since this will resolve an [`SdkConfig`] which can be shared
/// across multiple different AWS SDK clients. This config resolution process can be customized
/// by calling [`aws_config::from_env()`] instead, which returns a [`ConfigLoader`] that uses
/// the [builder pattern] to customize the default config.
///
/// In the simplest case, creating a client looks as follows:
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let client = aws_sdk_codecatalyst::Client::new(&config);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Occasionally, SDKs may have additional service-specific that can be set on the [`Config`] that
/// is absent from [`SdkConfig`], or slightly different settings for a specific client may be desired.
/// The [`Config`] struct implements `From<&SdkConfig>`, so setting these specific settings can be
/// done as follows:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # async fn wrapper() {
/// let sdk_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
/// let config = aws_sdk_codecatalyst::config::Builder::from(&sdk_config)
/// # /*
///     .some_service_specific_setting("value")
/// # */
///     .build();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// See the [`aws-config` docs] and [`Config`] for more information on customizing configuration.
///
/// _Note:_ Client construction is expensive due to connection thread pool initialization, and should
/// be done once at application start-up.
///

/// # Using the `Client`
///
/// A client has a function for every operation that can be performed by the service.
/// For example, the [`GetUserDetails`](crate::operation::get_user_details) operation has
/// a [`Client::get_user_details`], function which returns a builder for that operation.
/// The fluent builder ultimately has a `call()` function that returns an async future that
/// returns a result, as illustrated below:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = client.get_user_details()
///     .id("example")
///     .call()
///     .await;
/// ```
///
/// The underlying HTTP requests that get made by this can be modified with the `customize_operation`
/// function on the fluent builder. See the [`customize`](crate::client::customize) module for more
/// information.
