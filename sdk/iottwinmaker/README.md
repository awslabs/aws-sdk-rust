# aws-sdk-iottwinmaker

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

TwinMaker is in public preview and is subject to change.

IoT TwinMaker is a service that enables you to build operational digital twins of physical systems. IoT TwinMaker overlays measurements and analysis from real-world sensors, cameras, and enterprise applications so you can create data visualizations to monitor your physical factory, building, or industrial plant. You can use this real-world data to monitor operations and diagnose and repair errors.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-iottwinmaker` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.6.0"
aws-sdk-iottwinmaker = "0.6.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
