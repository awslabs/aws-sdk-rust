# aws-sdk-computeoptimizerautomation

Automation is a feature within Amazon Web Services Compute Optimizer that enables you to apply optimization recommendations to your Amazon Web Services resources, reducing costs and improving performance. You can apply recommended actions directly or create automation rules that implement recommendations on a recurring schedule when they match your specified criteria. With automation rules, set criteria such as Amazon Web Services Region and Resource Tags to target specific geographies and workloads. Configure rules to run daily, weekly, or monthly, and Compute Optimizer continuously evaluates new recommendations against your criteria. Track automation events over time, examine detailed step history, estimate savings achieved, and reverse actions directly from Compute Optimizer when needed.

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [usage examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/rustv1).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-computeoptimizerautomation` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1.1.7", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-computeoptimizerautomation = "1.0.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then in code, a client can be created with the following:

```rust,no_run
use aws_sdk_computeoptimizerautomation as computeoptimizerautomation;

#[::tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), computeoptimizerautomation::Error> {
    let config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_computeoptimizerautomation::Client::new(&config);

    // ... make some calls with the client

    Ok(())
}
```

See the [client documentation](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-computeoptimizerautomation/latest/aws_sdk_computeoptimizerautomation/client/struct.Client.html)
for information on what calls can be made, and the inputs and outputs for each of those calls.

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
