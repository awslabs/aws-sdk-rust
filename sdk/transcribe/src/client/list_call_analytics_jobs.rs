    ///   - [`status(CallAnalyticsJobStatus)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListCallAnalyticsJobs::status) / [`set_status(Option<CallAnalyticsJobStatus>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListCallAnalyticsJobs::set_status): <p>Returns only Call Analytics jobs with the specified status. Jobs are ordered by creation date, with the newest job first. If you don't include <code>Status</code>, all Call Analytics jobs are returned.</p>

To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat your request, including <code>NextToken</code> with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.</p>

If there are fewer results than the value that you specify, only the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a default of 5 is used.</p>
    /// - On success, responds with [`ListCallAnalyticsJobsOutput`](crate::output::ListCallAnalyticsJobsOutput) with field(s):
    ///   - [`status(Option<CallAnalyticsJobStatus>)`](crate::output::ListCallAnalyticsJobsOutput::status): <p>Lists all Call Analytics jobs that have the status specified in your request. Jobs are ordered by creation date, with the newest job first.</p>
