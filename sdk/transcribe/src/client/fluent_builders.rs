/// <p>Creates a new Call Analytics category.</p>
/// <p>All categories are automatically applied to your Call Analytics transcriptions. Note that in order to apply categories to your transcriptions, you must create them before submitting your transcription request, as categories cannot be applied retroactively.</p>
/// <p>When creating a new category, you can use the <code>InputType</code> parameter to label the category as a batch category (<code>POST_CALL</code>) or a streaming category (<code>REAL_TIME</code>).
