It's helpful to use a detailed naming system that will make sense to you in the future. For example, it's better to use <code>sentiment-positive-last30seconds</code> for a category over a generic name like <code>test-category</code>.</p>  <p>Category names are case sensitive.</p>
    ///   - [`rules(Vec<Rule>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateCallAnalyticsCategory::rules) / [`set_rules(Option<Vec<Rule>>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::CreateCallAnalyticsCategory::set_rules): <p>Rules define a Call Analytics category. When creating a new category, you must create between 1 and 20 rules for that category. For each rule, you specify a filter you want applied to the attributes of a call. For example, you can choose a sentiment filter that detects if a customer's sentiment was positive during the last 30 seconds of the call.</p>
