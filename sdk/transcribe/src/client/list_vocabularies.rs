To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat your request, including <code>NextToken</code> with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.</p>

If there are fewer results than the value that you specify, only the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a default of 5 is used.</p>

Vocabularies are ordered by creation date, with the newest vocabulary first. If you don't include <code>StateEquals</code>, all custom medical vocabularies are returned.</p>
    ///   - [`name_contains(impl Into<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListVocabularies::name_contains) / [`set_name_contains(Option<String>)`](crate::client::fluent_builders::ListVocabularies::set_name_contains): <p>Returns only the custom vocabularies that contain the specified string.
