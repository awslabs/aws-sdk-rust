    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`ListVocabularies`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder) operation.
    /// This operation supports pagination; See [`into_paginator()`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::into_paginator).

    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`next_token(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::next_token) / [`set_next_token(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::set_next_token): <p>If your <code>ListVocabularies</code> request returns more results than can be displayed, <code>NextToken</code> is displayed in the response with an associated string. To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat your request, including <code>NextToken</code> with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.</p>
    ///   - [`max_results(i32)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::max_results) / [`set_max_results(Option<i32>)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::set_max_results): <p>The maximum number of custom vocabularies to return in each page of results. If there are fewer results than the value that you specify, only the actual results are returned. If you don't specify a value, a default of 5 is used.</p>

Vocabularies are ordered by creation date, with the newest vocabulary first. If you don't include <code>StateEquals</code>, all custom medical vocabularies are returned.</p>
    ///   - [`name_contains(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::name_contains) / [`set_name_contains(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::list_vocabularies::builders::ListVocabulariesFluentBuilder::set_name_contains): <p>Returns only the custom vocabularies that contain the specified string.
