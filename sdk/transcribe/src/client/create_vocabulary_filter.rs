If you try to create a new custom vocabulary filter with the same name as an existing custom vocabulary filter, you get a <code>ConflictException</code> error.</p>

Each custom vocabulary filter must contain terms in only one language.</p>  <p>A custom vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a custom vocabulary filter using US English (<code>en-US</code>), you can only apply this filter to files that contain English audio.</p>  <p>For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html">Supported languages</a> table.</p>

The other option for creating your vocabulary filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the <code>VocabularyFilterFileUri</code> parameter.</p>  <p>Note that if you include <code>Words</code> in your request, you cannot use <code>VocabularyFilterFileUri</code>; you must choose one or the other.</p>  <p>Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/charsets.html">Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies</a> to get the character set for your language.</p>

The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the resource you're calling.</p>  <p>Here's an example URI path: <code>s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-filter-file.txt</code> </p>  <p>Note that if you include <code>VocabularyFilterFileUri</code> in your request, you cannot use <code>Words</code>; you must choose one or the other.</p>
