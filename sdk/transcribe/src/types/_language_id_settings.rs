/// <p>If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include <code>LanguageIdSettings</code> with the relevant sub-parameters (<code>VocabularyName</code>, <code>LanguageModelName</code>, and <code>VocabularyFilterName</code>). Note that multi-language identification (<code>IdentifyMultipleLanguages</code>) doesn't support custom language models.</p> 
/// <p> <code>LanguageIdSettings</code> supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.</p> 
/// <p>It's recommended that you include <code>LanguageOptions</code> when using <code>LanguageIdSettings</code> to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in <code>en-US</code> but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is <code>en-AU</code>, your custom vocabulary <i>is not</i> applied to your transcription. If you include <code>LanguageOptions</code> and include <code>en-US</code> as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary <i>is</i> applied to your transcription.</p> 
/// <p>If you want to include a custom language model with your request but <b>do not</b> want to use automatic language identification, use instead the <code></code> parameter with the <code>LanguageModelName</code> sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but <b>do not</b> want to use automatic language identification, use instead the <code></code> parameter with the <code>VocabularyName</code> or <code>VocabularyFilterName</code> (or both) sub-parameter.</p>
