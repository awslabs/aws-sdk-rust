# aws-sdk-shield

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This is the _Shield Advanced API Reference_. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Shield Advanced API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF and Shield Advanced features and an overview of how to use the WAF and Shield Advanced APIs, see the [WAF and Shield Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-shield` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.2.0"
aws-sdk-shield = "0.2.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/main/Guide.md). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
