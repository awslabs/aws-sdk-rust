Shield Advanced will not return more than <code>MaxResults</code> objects, but may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.</p>  <p>Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has not yet returned to you, the response will include a <code>NextToken</code> value.</p>  <p>On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.</p>

Shield Advanced might return fewer objects than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects are available. If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will always also return a <code>NextToken</code> value in the response.</p>  <p>The default setting is 20.</p>

You can retrieve a single protection group by its name and you can retrieve all protection groups that are configured with specific pattern or aggregation settings. You can provide up to one criteria per filter type. Shield Advanced returns the protection groups that exactly match all of the search criteria that you provide.</p>
