You can retrieve the next batch of objects by requesting the list again and providing the token that was returned by the prior call in your request. </p>  <p>You can indicate the maximum number of objects that you want Shield Advanced to return for a single call with the <code>MaxResults</code> setting. Shield Advanced will not return more than <code>MaxResults</code> objects, but may return fewer, even if more objects are still available.</p>  <p>Whenever more objects remain that Shield Advanced has not yet returned to you, the response will include a <code>NextToken</code> value.</p>  <p>On your first call to a list operation, leave this setting empty.</p>

Shield Advanced might return fewer objects than you indicate in this setting, even if more objects are available. If there are more objects remaining, Shield Advanced will always also return a <code>NextToken</code> value in the response.</p>  <p>The default setting is 20.</p>

You can retrieve a single protection by providing its name or the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of its protected resource. You can also retrieve all protections for a specific resource type. You can provide up to one criteria per filter type. Shield Advanced returns protections that exactly match all of the filter criteria that you provide.</p>
