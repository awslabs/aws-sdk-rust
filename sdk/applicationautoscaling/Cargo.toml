You can\n          suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are\n          triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy,\n          and scheduled scaling.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n\n      \n         <p>To learn more about Application Auto Scaling, including information about granting IAM users required\n      permissions for Application Auto Scaling actions, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/what-is-application-auto-scaling.html\">Application Auto Scaling User\n        Guide</a>.</p>"
