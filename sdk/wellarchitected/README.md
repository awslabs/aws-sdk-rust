# aws-sdk-wellarchitected

**Please Note: The SDK is currently in Developer Preview and is intended strictly for
feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

This is the _Well-Architected Tool API Reference_. The WA Tool API provides programmatic access to the [Well-Architected Tool](http://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool) in the [Amazon Web Services Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected). For information about the Well-Architected Tool, see the [Well-Architected Tool User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html).

## Getting Started

> Examples are available for many services and operations, check out the
> [examples folder in GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples).

The SDK provides one crate per AWS service. You must add [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)
as a dependency within your Rust project to execute asynchronous code. To add `aws-sdk-wellarchitected` to
your project, add the following to your **Cargo.toml** file:

```toml
[dependencies]
aws-config = "0.10.1"
aws-sdk-wellarchitected = "0.10.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Using the SDK

Until the SDK is released, we will be adding information about using the SDK to the
[Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/welcome.html). Feel free to suggest
additional sections for the guide by opening an issue and describing what you are trying to do.
