/// <p>If you are applying controls through an Amazon Web Services Control Tower landing zone environment, remember that the values returned in the <code>RegionConfiguration</code> API operation are not related to the governed Regions in your landing zone. For example, if you are governing Regions <code>A</code>,<code>B</code>,and <code>C</code> while the control is available in Regions <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, C<code>,</code> and <code>D</code>, you'd see a response with <code>DeployableRegions</code> of <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code> for a control with <code>REGIONAL</code> scope, even though you may not intend to deploy the control in Region <code>D</code>, because you do not govern it through your landing zone.</p>
