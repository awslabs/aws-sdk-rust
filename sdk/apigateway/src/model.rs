/// When writing a match expression against `VpcLinkStatus`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let vpclinkstatus = unimplemented!();
/// match vpclinkstatus {
///     VpcLinkStatus::Available => { /* ... */ },
///     VpcLinkStatus::Deleting => { /* ... */ },
///     VpcLinkStatus::Failed => { /* ... */ },
///     VpcLinkStatus::Pending => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `vpclinkstatus` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `VpcLinkStatus::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `VpcLinkStatus::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `VpcLinkStatus::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `vpclinkstatus` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `VpcLinkStatus::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.

A content type is unmapped if no mapping template is defined in the integration or the content type does not match any of the mapped content types, as specified in <code>requestTemplates</code>. The valid value is one of the following: <code>WHEN_NO_MATCH</code>: passes the method request body through the integration request to the back end without transformation when the method request content type does not match any content type associated with the mapping templates defined in the integration request. <code>WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES</code>: passes the method request body through the integration request to the back end without transformation when no mapping template is defined in the integration request. If a template is defined when this option is selected, the method request of an unmapped content-type will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response. <code>NEVER</code>: rejects the method request with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response when either the method request content type does not match any content type associated with the mapping templates defined in the integration request or no mapping template is defined in the integration request.</p>

/// When writing a match expression against `DocumentationPartType`, it is important to ensure

/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let documentationparttype = unimplemented!();
/// match documentationparttype {
///     DocumentationPartType::Api => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::Authorizer => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::Method => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::Model => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::PathParameter => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::QueryParameter => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::RequestBody => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::RequestHeader => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::Resource => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::Response => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::ResponseBody => { /* ... */ },
///     DocumentationPartType::ResponseHeader => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `documentationparttype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `DocumentationPartType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `DocumentationPartType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `DocumentationPartType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `documentationparttype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `DocumentationPartType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.

/// When writing a match expression against `LocationStatusType`, it is important to ensure
/// your code is forward-compatible. That is, if a match arm handles a case for a
/// feature that is supported by the service but has not been represented as an enum
/// variant in a current version of SDK, your code should continue to work when you
/// upgrade SDK to a future version in which the enum does include a variant for that
/// feature.
/// 
/// Here is an example of how you can make a match expression forward-compatible:
/// 
/// ```text
/// # let locationstatustype = unimplemented!();
/// match locationstatustype {
///     LocationStatusType::Documented => { /* ... */ },
///     LocationStatusType::Undocumented => { /* ... */ },
///     other @ _ if other.as_str() == "NewFeature" => { /* handles a case for `NewFeature` */ },
///     _ => { /* ... */ },
/// }
/// ```
/// The above code demonstrates that when `locationstatustype` represents
/// `NewFeature`, the execution path will lead to the second last match arm,
/// even though the enum does not contain a variant `LocationStatusType::NewFeature`
/// in the current version of SDK. The reason is that the variable `other`,
/// created by the `@` operator, is bound to
/// `LocationStatusType::Unknown(UnknownVariantValue("NewFeature".to_owned()))`
/// and calling `as_str` on it yields `"NewFeature"`.
/// This match expression is forward-compatible when executed with a newer
/// version of SDK where the variant `LocationStatusType::NewFeature` is defined.
/// Specifically, when `locationstatustype` represents `NewFeature`,
/// the execution path will hit the second last match arm as before by virtue of
/// calling `as_str` on `LocationStatusType::NewFeature` also yielding `"NewFeature"`.
/// 
/// Explicitly matching on the `Unknown` variant should
/// be avoided for two reasons:
/// - The inner data `UnknownVariantValue` is opaque, and no further information can be extracted.
/// - It might inadvertently shadow other intended match arms.
