/// An ergonomic service client for `BackplaneControlService`.

/// This client allows ergonomic access to a `BackplaneControlService`-shaped service.
/// Each method corresponds to an endpoint defined in the service's Smithy model,
/// and the request and response shapes are auto-generated from that same model.
///
/// # Using a Client
///
/// Once you have a client set up, you can access the service's endpoints
/// by calling the appropriate method on [`Client`]. Each such method
/// returns a request builder for that endpoint, with methods for setting
/// the various fields of the request. Once your request is complete, use
/// the `send` method to send the request. `send` returns a future, which
/// you then have to `.await` to get the service's response.
