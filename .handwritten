# This file tracks files and folders that are maintained by hand. These files
# and folders will be left untouched when this repo is automatically synced
# with smithy-rs. Any file or folder not included in this list will be removed
# and replaced as a part of the sync. This config format ignores empty lines
# and lines that start with a hashmark (#).
